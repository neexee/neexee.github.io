      <description>This is how senior IT architects and CTOs understand change. To me, it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty unusual point of view. It explains the roles and qualities of an architect in a large enterprise, and how to train yourself to achieve those qualities. It includes expert advice on how to explain stuff, draw diagrams, examine architecture, to name a few.
The book is not about systems architecture.
The writing is superb, it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to read and profound at the same time.</description>
