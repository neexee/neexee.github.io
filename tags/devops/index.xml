      <description>I cannot say anything bad about this book, only good. It&amp;rsquo;s full of quality content and it&amp;rsquo;s a joy to read. Title says for itself, it&amp;rsquo;s a book for DevOps engineer. But I would recommend it to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s just slightly interested in security, clouds or CI/CD. The author builds a CI/CD pipeline throughout first part of the book and explains useful security practices in the rest of the book. It has many real-life examples and many very good explanations.</description>
