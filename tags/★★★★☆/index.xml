      <description>Nice little book. It could be an eye-opening read for a CS student as it has a lot of good advice on medium and low-level code structure. It&amp;rsquo;s not as useful for a professional programmer, but it could be used for reading for pleasure. It has a couple of concepts with catchy names like &amp;ldquo;define errors out of existence&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;modules should be deep&amp;rdquo; which I like because they&amp;rsquo;re quite practical and rich.</description>

      <title>Software Architecture in Practice</title>

      <description>The book is very complex. The topic is not easy and writing style of the authors makes it worse.
Some ideas are good but explanations are overly long. It could be much shorter, maybe a medium-sized blog post. I had a feeling that authors tried to cram into it everything they find useful about architecture. Links to aerospace standards (who needs them in a book like this?), clumsy discussion of product lines (an entire chapter is useless) and many more.</description>

      <description>Useful read. I no longer believe those who talk about things selling &amp;ldquo;below their real value&amp;rdquo; or about how terrible it is for the United States to be &amp;ldquo;a debtor nation&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m skeptic about government programs to make this or that &amp;ldquo;affordable&amp;rdquo;. Same skepticism goes for statements and statistics about &amp;ldquo;the rich&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the poor&amp;rdquo;. Same with notion of &amp;ldquo;greed&amp;rdquo; of capitalists. It&amp;rsquo;s not mysterious why so many places with rent control laws also have housing shortages.</description>

      <description>Awesome book. It alleviated some of my scariest anxieties.
Future anxiety. Before I read it I thought I would miss something new if I&amp;rsquo;m not going to read about new shiny things every day. Turns out, new developments are not that important. People cannot solve the same problems for centuries, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to read classics to anticipate future.
Health anxiety. Health is complex. Doctors don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and almost always create problems on the long run.</description>
