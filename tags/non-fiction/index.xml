      <description>Useful read. I no longer believe those who talk about things selling &amp;ldquo;below their real value&amp;rdquo; or about how terrible it is for the United States to be &amp;ldquo;a debtor nation&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m skeptic about government programs to make this or that &amp;ldquo;affordable&amp;rdquo;. Same skepticism goes for statements and statistics about &amp;ldquo;the rich&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the poor&amp;rdquo;. Same with notion of &amp;ldquo;greed&amp;rdquo; of capitalists. It&amp;rsquo;s not mysterious why so many places with rent control laws also have housing shortages.</description>

      <title>Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin To Munger</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a compilation of ideas from other books about thought process debugging. At least the first half. Writing is concise. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of deep quotes.
The second half was mostly about Buffet&amp;rsquo;s and Munger&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on investment bullshit so it was pretty useless.
&amp;ldquo;I read it in the New England Journal of Medicine, so it must be correct&amp;rdquo;.
Names and reputation influence us. And symbols of power or status like titles, possessions, rank, uniforms, or a nice suit and tie.</description>

      <description>Awesome book. It alleviated some of my scariest anxieties.
Future anxiety. Before I read it I thought I would miss something new if I&amp;rsquo;m not going to read about new shiny things every day. Turns out, new developments are not that important. People cannot solve the same problems for centuries, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to read classics to anticipate future.
Health anxiety. Health is complex. Doctors don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and almost always create problems on the long run.</description>

      <title>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</title>

      <description>I decided to read it because at the time of reading I had to draw a lot statistical graphs at my work and I had no idea how to do it in a best possible way. I&amp;rsquo;ve read it and convinced myself even more about facts I already knew:
 Piecharts are worthless and misleading. You need to note everything on your graph, especially axes. Your graphs shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too smart.</description>
