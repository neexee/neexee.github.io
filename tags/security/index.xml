      <title>Data ≠ Information, Information ≠ Understanding</title>

      <description>Data ≠ Information I was working in a company making most of its money on online advertising. It wasn’t very intrusive, most of the users didn’t even suspect there’s some advertising involved. Users were searching for flower stores, restaurants and so on, and advertised businesses were close to the top in search results.
I left the company, but the experience put some everlasting questions in me. What if companies stopped pouring money into online advertising?</description>

      <title>Securing DevOps: Security in the Cloud</title>

      <description>I cannot say anything bad about this book, only good. It&amp;rsquo;s full of quality content and it&amp;rsquo;s a joy to read. Title says for itself, it&amp;rsquo;s a book for DevOps engineer. But I would recommend it to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s just slightly interested in security, clouds or CI/CD. The author builds a CI/CD pipeline throughout first part of the book and explains useful security practices in the rest of the book. It has many real-life examples and many very good explanations.</description>
