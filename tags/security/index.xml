      <description>Both movements are really helpful for explaining to people that they should automate everything. They also create discipline. For most situations, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to provision a server for several hours. But there&amp;rsquo;s a catch: if it takes over 10 minutes, you&amp;rsquo;ll be tempted to do some step manually. And you&amp;rsquo;ll do it manually. This is how slow-moving chaos begins in an organization. It generates huge losses over time.
DevSecOps is welcome because it can resolve the conflict between DevOps and security.</description>

      <description>Data â‰  Information I was working in a company making most of its money on online advertising. It wasnâ€™t very intrusive, most of the users didnâ€™t even suspect thereâ€™s some advertising involved. Users were searching for flower stores, restaurants and so on, and advertised businesses were close to the top in search results.
I left the company, but the experience put some everlasting questions in me. What if companies stopped pouring money into online advertising?</description>

      <description>Definition In short, it&amp;rsquo;s SecurityÂ Orchestration,Â Automation AndÂ Response.
SOAR refers to technologies that enable organizations to collect inputs monitored by the security operations team. For example, alerts from the SIEM system and other security technologies â€” where incident analysis and triage can be performed by leveraging a combination of human and machine power â€” help define, prioritize and drive standardized incident response activities. SOAR tools allow an organization to define incident analysis and response procedures in a digital workflow format.</description>

      <title>Securing DevOps: Security in the Cloud</title>

      <description>I cannot say anything bad about this book, only good. It&amp;rsquo;s full of quality content and it&amp;rsquo;s a joy to read. Title says for itself, it&amp;rsquo;s a book for DevOps engineer. But I would recommend it to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s just slightly interested in security, clouds or CI/CD. The author builds a CI/CD pipeline throughout first part of the book and explains useful security practices in the rest of the book. It has many real-life examples and many very good explanations.</description>
