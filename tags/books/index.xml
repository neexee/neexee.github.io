      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s painful to take out quotes from PocketBook using PocketBook itself. The interface is slow and the default reader app (the best one in my opinion) has no option for bulk imports of quotes.
So I wrote a simple script to extract &amp;amp; transform quotes from the internal PocketBook DB.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I read it in the New England Journal of Medicine, so it must be correct&amp;rdquo;.
Names and reputation influence us. And symbols of power or status like titles, possessions, rank, uniforms, or a nice suit and tie.

All but one nurse obeyed.</description>

      <description>Awesome book. It alleviated some of my scariest anxieties.
Future anxiety. Before I read it I thought I would miss something new if I&amp;rsquo;m not going to read about new shiny things every day. Turns out, new developments are not that important. People cannot solve the same problems for centuries, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to read classics to anticipate future.
Health anxiety. Health is complex. Doctors don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and almost always create problems on the long run.</description>
