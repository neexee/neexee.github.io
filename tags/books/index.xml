      <description>Awesome book, joy to read. It&amp;rsquo;s dense, but written in a cheerful tone. The author knows a lot about web security. It&amp;rsquo;s not bound to a narrow set of technologies, frameworks, OSes or browsers. It touches a little bit of everything. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it shallow. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware about 90% of information presented in this book. It has no cumbersome and useless terms security charlatans like. It&amp;rsquo;s very practical and full of advice.</description>

      <title>PocketBook Quote Export</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s painful to take out quotes from PocketBook using PocketBook itself. The interface is slow and the default reader app (the best one in my opinion) has no option for bulk imports of quotes.
So I wrote a simple script to extract &amp;amp; transform quotes from the internal PocketBook DB.
The PocketBook database schema   The quote extractor You may want to change the default path of the DB, filter_quote, transform_quote and print_results.</description>

      <title>Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin To Munger</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a compilation of ideas from other books about thought process debugging. At least the first half. Writing is concise. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of deep quotes.
The second half was mostly about Buffet&amp;rsquo;s and Munger&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on investment bullshit so it was pretty useless.
&amp;ldquo;I read it in the New England Journal of Medicine, so it must be correct&amp;rdquo;.
Names and reputation influence us. And symbols of power or status like titles, possessions, rank, uniforms, or a nice suit and tie.</description>

      <description>Awesome book. It alleviated some of my scariest anxieties.
Future anxiety. Before I read it I thought I would miss something new if I&amp;rsquo;m not going to read about new shiny things every day. Turns out, new developments are not that important. People cannot solve the same problems for centuries, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to read classics to anticipate future.
Health anxiety. Health is complex. Doctors don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and almost always create problems on the long run.</description>
