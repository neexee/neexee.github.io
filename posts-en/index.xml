      <title>How to Win Friends and Influence People</title>

      <description>It has great overview of techniques for non-toxic conversations but it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit dangerous and shallow. I was walking around it for years and was afraid it&amp;rsquo;s a collection of insecure tricks for used car salesmans. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to read and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of examples from lives of famous (and not-so-famous) people. So it&amp;rsquo;s a worthy read if you just want to entertain yourself.
What do I mean by dangerous?</description>

      <title>Software Architecture in Practice</title>

      <description>The book is very complex. The topic is not easy and writing style of the authors makes it worse.
Some ideas are good but explanations are overly long. It could be much shorter, maybe a medium-sized blog post. I had a feeling that authors tried to cram into it everything they find useful about architecture. Links to aerospace standards (who needs them in a book like this?), clumsy discussion of product lines (an entire chapter is useless) and many more.</description>

      <title>Working with secrets in Ansible</title>

      <description>Secrets in your yaml-files should be encrypted. The default Ansible method encrypts an entire file, but it&amp;rsquo;s inconvenient in practice. It&amp;rsquo;s much better to encrypt specific variables. It makes Ansible code easier to analyze as you can see encrypted variable name. And it&amp;rsquo;s nice to run your playbook without vault key if the secret variable is unused during play.
Ansible documentation mentions variable-level encryption but offers no oneliner solution.
Visual Studio Code has a nice plugin, ansible-vault-inline.</description>

      <title>Developer Hegemony: The Future of Labor</title>

      <description>Totally worth your time, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re knowledge worker and you feel like grunt from time to time. I expected the book to be a little bit crazy but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. The entire corporation-driven sector of the IT industry is crazy instead.
This book is an in-depth version of Don&amp;rsquo;t Call Yourself A Programmer article, one of my favourites. And by &amp;ldquo;in-depth&amp;rdquo; I mean really deep dive into the delusion of &amp;ldquo;real programmer&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Useful read. I no longer believe those who talk about things selling &amp;ldquo;below their real value&amp;rdquo; or about how terrible it is for the United States to be &amp;ldquo;a debtor nation&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m skeptic about government programs to make this or that &amp;ldquo;affordable&amp;rdquo;. Same skepticism goes for statements and statistics about &amp;ldquo;the rich&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the poor&amp;rdquo;. Same with notion of &amp;ldquo;greed&amp;rdquo; of capitalists. It&amp;rsquo;s not mysterious why so many places with rent control laws also have housing shortages.</description>

      <description>Awesome book, joy to read. It&amp;rsquo;s dense, but written in a cheerful tone. The author knows a lot about web security. It&amp;rsquo;s not bound to a narrow set of technologies, frameworks, OSes or browsers. It touches a little bit of everything. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it shallow. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware about 90% of information presented in this book. It has no cumbersome and useless terms security charlatans like. It&amp;rsquo;s very practical and full of advice.</description>

      <title>PocketBook Quote Export</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s painful to take out quotes from PocketBook using PocketBook itself. The interface is slow and the default reader app (the best one in my opinion) has no option for bulk imports of quotes.
So I wrote a simple script to extract &amp;amp; transform quotes from the internal PocketBook DB.
The PocketBook database schema   The quote extractor You may want to change the default path of the DB, filter_quote, transform_quote and print_results.</description>

      <title>Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin To Munger</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a compilation of ideas from other books about thought process debugging. At least the first half. Writing is concise. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of deep quotes.
The second half was mostly about Buffet&amp;rsquo;s and Munger&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on investment bullshit so it was pretty useless.
&amp;ldquo;I read it in the New England Journal of Medicine, so it must be correct&amp;rdquo;.
Names and reputation influence us. And symbols of power or status like titles, possessions, rank, uniforms, or a nice suit and tie.</description>

      <description>Awesome book. It alleviated some of my scariest anxieties.
Future anxiety. Before I read it I thought I would miss something new if I&amp;rsquo;m not going to read about new shiny things every day. Turns out, new developments are not that important. People cannot solve the same problems for centuries, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to read classics to anticipate future.
Health anxiety. Health is complex. Doctors don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and almost always create problems on the long run.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of typed Python.
import itertools from typing import Callable, Iterable, List, Tuple, TypeVar A = TypeVar(&amp;#39;A&amp;#39;) B = TypeVar(&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;) def groupby_eager(iterable: Iterable[A], key: Callable[[A], B]) -&amp;gt; List[Tuple[B, List[A]]]: groups = itertools.groupby(sorted(iterable, key=key), key=key) return [ (group_name, list(group)) for group_name, group in groups ]</description>

      <description>I decided to read it because at the time of reading I had to draw a lot statistical graphs at my work and I had no idea how to do it in a best possible way. I&amp;rsquo;ve read it and convinced myself even more about facts I already knew:
 Piecharts are worthless and misleading. You need to note everything on your graph, especially axes. Your graphs shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too smart.</description>

      <description>Faults and cracks:
 Fault. A condition that creates an incorrect internal state in your software. A fault may be due to a latent bug that gets triggered, or it may be due to an unchecked condition at a boundary or external interface. Error. Visibly incorrect behavior. When your trading system suddenly buys ten billion dollars of Pokemon futures, that is an error. Failure. An unresponsive system. When a system doesn’t respond, we say it has failed.</description>
