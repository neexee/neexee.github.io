      <description>Imagine a situation. You&amp;rsquo;re having a backend serving music. It has an API level, some domain logic, and storage. You have different kinds of entities in the API (tracks, playlists, and so on) and you need some way to filter them. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of entities stored in the storage so you have to invent a paging strategy for them.
That&amp;rsquo;s what you probably come up with for client requests:</description>

      <description>Consider this classic question, raised in the context of Go and API compatibility:
#golang friends, here&amp;#39;s a fun one
v1: func Process() error { return ErrFoo }
v2: func Process() error { return ErrBar }
Did I break API compatibility? Do I need to bump the major version?

      <description>If in doubt, engineers should do as product managers say. This is because product managers have a wider context. For example, they&amp;rsquo;re aware of the market. They also know priorities on all levels of an organization.
A person having a wider context is a leader by default. A leader can step back sometimes and let others lead. For example, he can ask subordinates to teach him. Subordinates should be careful because teaching the leader without invite may be considered rude and may lead to unpredictable results.</description>

      <title>The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a very wide mix of explanations about computation, biology, physics, creativity, politics, and philosophy. The explanations are pretty deep, so they explain an infinite number of phenomena. So they stand at the beginning of infinity.
The book resolved many questions for me. For example:
 What is optimism? How much a human can understand? How far we can go exploring the Universe? How to make a successful meme? Why don&amp;rsquo;t we have AI yet?</description>

      <description>Open source software development is an infinitely scalable art. All other types of development are not art or not infinitely scalable. It&amp;rsquo;s important to get some things right to make it truly &amp;lsquo;infinitely scalable art&amp;rsquo;.
First of all, quality is always a top priority for good art. Quality makes software predictable. An unpredictable open-source project is just trash. Open source projects should be reference projects in their domain. People rarely reference low-quality projects.</description>

      <description>Both movements are really helpful for explaining to people that they should automate everything. They also create discipline. For most situations, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to provision a server for several hours. But there&amp;rsquo;s a catch: if it takes over 10 minutes, you&amp;rsquo;ll be tempted to do some step manually. And you&amp;rsquo;ll do it manually. This is how slow-moving chaos begins in an organization. It generates huge losses over time.
DevSecOps is welcome because it can resolve the conflict between DevOps and security.</description>

      <description>Any documentation is very advantageous to a spoken word because it scales, itâ€™s searchable, and it can be edited and versioned.
Here I list common problems and solutions for technical documentation:
 It&amp;rsquo;s complicated. Avoid cliffs of understanding, build a ramp for your audience. Split documents into categories and try not to mix them (tutorial, reference, explanation, requirements and so on). Read &amp;ldquo;Elements of style&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;On writing well&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s big.</description>

      <guid>https://neexee.github.io/posts-en/37-things-one-architect-knows/</guid>
      <description>This is how senior IT architects and CTOs understand change. To me, it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty unusual point of view. It explains the roles and qualities of an architect in a large enterprise, and how to train yourself to achieve those qualities. It includes expert advice on how to explain stuff, draw diagrams, examine architecture, to name a few.
The book is not about systems architecture.
The writing is superb, it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to read and profound at the same time.</description>

      <description>Data â‰  Information I was working in a company making most of its money on online advertising. It wasnâ€™t very intrusive, most of the users didnâ€™t even suspect thereâ€™s some advertising involved. Users were searching for flower stores, restaurants and so on, and advertised businesses were close to the top in search results.
I left the company, but the experience put some everlasting questions in me. What if companies stopped pouring money into online advertising?</description>

      <description>Definition In short, it&amp;rsquo;s SecurityÂ Orchestration,Â Automation AndÂ Response.
SOAR refers to technologies that enable organizations to collect inputs monitored by the security operations team. For example, alerts from the SIEM system and other security technologies â€” where incident analysis and triage can be performed by leveraging a combination of human and machine power â€” help define, prioritize and drive standardized incident response activities. SOAR tools allow an organization to define incident analysis and response procedures in a digital workflow format.</description>

      <description>I cannot say anything bad about this book, only good. It&amp;rsquo;s full of quality content and it&amp;rsquo;s a joy to read. Title says for itself, it&amp;rsquo;s a book for DevOps engineer. But I would recommend it to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s just slightly interested in security, clouds or CI/CD. The author builds a CI/CD pipeline throughout first part of the book and explains useful security practices in the rest of the book. It has many real-life examples and many very good explanations.</description>

      <description>Nice little book. It could be an eye-opening read for a CS student as it has a lot of good advice on medium and low-level code structure. It&amp;rsquo;s not as useful for a professional programmer, but it could be used for reading for pleasure. It has a couple of concepts with catchy names like &amp;ldquo;define errors out of existence&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;modules should be deep&amp;rdquo; which I like because they&amp;rsquo;re quite practical and rich.</description>

      <guid>https://neexee.github.io/posts-en/domain-driven-design/</guid>
      <description>The book presents a very interesting approach to modeling complex domains, especially with established terms.
The code should look as a sentence said by a domain expert. Thatâ€™s the core idea. The rest is a lengthy guide to listening to domain experts and mapping their sayings to the code.
Pros:
 Brilliant idea, totally worth knowing I could finally understand most of the content on Fowlerâ€™s blog  Cons:
 Itâ€™s very hard to follow the author.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you need strong consistency guarantees and transactions can not provide them. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s not a good smell, but in this situation you usually don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of choices.
The easy choice is PostgreSQL advisory lock. But it should be used carefully, especially if you use database connection pools.
Imagine a type LockStorage allowing to create, wait, and release advisory locks.
package main import ( &amp;#34;context&amp;#34; &amp;#34;database/sql&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; ) const pgLockKey = 13 type LockStorage struct { db *sql.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of structured logging libraries for Go but there&amp;rsquo;s no good guideline on how to use them. This article explains how to get the most of your logs using those libraries.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in underlying assumptions for this guideline, check out the previous article What is Structured Logging.
How to populate a context Every logging library has a notion of context. Context groups log entries about a single task.</description>

      <description>Regular logs are hard to get right. Usually, people just want do debug issues using them. Debugging is messy so logs become a mess.
Structured logging allows to clean up the mess a little bit. It even allows draw a graph of an event type from logs in Kibana and similar instruments with ease.
Structured logging is even harder to get right than regular logs. But if you look at ways you can perceive a log, it becomes clear how a good log should look like.</description>

      <description>I have mixed feelings about this book. It&amp;rsquo;s well-written on a small scale (pages, chapters) but the overall structure is a mystery to me.
Did I find a way how to organize a mess in my notes? Not exactly, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found some good hints.
Good bits:
 GTD doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for non-linear writing. Academic writing is non-linear. I was taught otherwise. Organize your notes around the context in which they&amp;rsquo;re going to be useful.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s short and very well-written. It&amp;rsquo;s the most valuable read on SQL I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. The book is available online.
The most important thing for backend developers is &amp;ldquo;Do NOT use OFFSET for pagination&amp;rdquo;.
Powers of indexing:
 The B-Tree traversal. It could be traversed in any direction as leaf nodes are organized in a double linked list. Clustering. Similar data is close, especially if it&amp;rsquo;s an index-only scan.</description>

      <description>If you like listen to long stories of your friends, give it a try.
I expected something different.
First of all, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a book. The writing is terrible. It could not be fixed by editing because almost an entire book is based on recorded audio conversations of Feynman and his friend.
I was agonizing for the first 100 pages or so. It was too narcissistic. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s okay, he was a kid and teenager at this time.</description>

      <description>A collection of masterpieces. Watts discusses important concepts and he goes pretty deep. Important concepts are time, Universe, God, work, ego and death. There&amp;rsquo;s no dogmatic bullshit, just a call to try to see things differently.
Sadly, I already knew most of the content from other sources. I wish I could erase my memory and read it as a completely mind-blowing book. Examples of main ideas? Past doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. You don&amp;rsquo;t exist.</description>

      <description>It has great overview of techniques for non-toxic conversations but it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit dangerous and shallow. I was walking around it for years and was afraid it&amp;rsquo;s a collection of insecure tricks for used car salesmans. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to read and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of examples from lives of famous (and not-so-famous) people. So it&amp;rsquo;s a worthy read if you just want to entertain yourself.

      <description>The book is very complex. The topic is not easy and writing style of the authors makes it worse.
Some ideas are good but explanations are overly long. It could be much shorter, maybe a medium-sized blog post. I had a feeling that authors tried to cram into it everything they find useful about architecture. Links to aerospace standards (who needs them in a book like this?), clumsy discussion of product lines (an entire chapter is useless) and many more.</description>

      <description>Secrets in your yaml-files should be encrypted. The default Ansible method encrypts an entire file, but it&amp;rsquo;s inconvenient in practice. It&amp;rsquo;s much better to encrypt specific variables. It makes Ansible code easier to analyze as you can see encrypted variable name. And it&amp;rsquo;s nice to run your playbook without vault key if the secret variable is unused during play.
Ansible documentation mentions variable-level encryption but offers no oneliner solution.
Visual Studio Code has a nice plugin, ansible-vault-inline.</description>

      <description>Useful read. I no longer believe those who talk about things selling &amp;ldquo;below their real value&amp;rdquo; or about how terrible it is for the United States to be &amp;ldquo;a debtor nation&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m skeptic about government programs to make this or that &amp;ldquo;affordable&amp;rdquo;. Same skepticism goes for statements and statistics about &amp;ldquo;the rich&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the poor&amp;rdquo;. Same with notion of &amp;ldquo;greed&amp;rdquo; of capitalists. It&amp;rsquo;s not mysterious why so many places with rent control laws also have housing shortages.</description>

      <description>Awesome book, joy to read. It&amp;rsquo;s dense, but written in a cheerful tone. The author knows a lot about web security. It&amp;rsquo;s not bound to a narrow set of technologies, frameworks, OSes or browsers. It touches a little bit of everything. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it shallow. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware about 90% of information presented in this book. It has no cumbersome and useless terms security charlatans like.

So I wrote a simple script to extract &amp;amp; transform quotes from the internal PocketBook DB.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a compilation of ideas from other books about thought process debugging. At least the first half. Writing is concise. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of deep quotes.
The second half was mostly about Buffet&amp;rsquo;s and Munger&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on investment bullshit so it was pretty useless.

      <description>Awesome book. It alleviated some of my scariest anxieties.
Future anxiety. Before I read it I thought I would miss something new if I&amp;rsquo;m not going to read about new shiny things every day. Turns out, new developments are not that important. People cannot solve the same problems for centuries, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to read classics to anticipate future.
Health anxiety. Health is complex. Doctors don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and almost always create problems on the long run.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of typed Python.
import itertools from typing import Callable, Iterable, List, Tuple, TypeVar A = TypeVar(&amp;#39;A&amp;#39;) B = TypeVar(&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;) def groupby_eager(iterable: Iterable[A], key: Callable[[A], B]) -&amp;gt; List[Tuple[B, List[A]]]: groups = itertools.groupby(sorted(iterable, key=key), key=key) return [ (group_name, list(group)) for group_name, group in groups ]</description>

      <description>I decided to read it because at the time of reading I had to draw a lot statistical graphs at my work and I had no idea how to do it in a best possible way. I&amp;rsquo;ve read it and convinced myself even more about facts I already knew:
 Piecharts are worthless and misleading. You need to note everything on your graph, especially axes. Your graphs shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too smart.</description>

      <description>Faults and cracks:
 Fault. A condition that creates an incorrect internal state in your software. A fault may be due to a latent bug that gets triggered, or it may be due to an unchecked condition at a boundary or external interface. Error. Visibly incorrect behavior. When your trading system suddenly buys ten billion dollars of Pokemon futures, that is an error. Failure. An unresponsive system. When a system doesnâ€™t respond, we say it has failed.</description>
