<p>It has great overview of techniques for non-toxic conversations but it&rsquo;s a little bit dangerous and shallow. I was walking around it for years and was afraid it&rsquo;s a collection of insecure tricks for used car salesmans. It&rsquo;s easy to read and there&rsquo;s a lot of examples from lives of famous (and not-so-famous) people. So it&rsquo;s a worthy read if you just want to entertain yourself.</p>

<p>What do I mean by dangerous? It&rsquo;s very easy to fall into a people-pleaser mentality after reading this. Applied bluntly, advice from this book may lead to flattery and many people despise it.</p>

<p>What do I mean by shallow? It has answers on &lsquo;how&rsquo;-questions, not &lsquo;why&rsquo;. How to make a good first impression? How to criticize and not be hated for it? It&rsquo;s not obvious why Carnegies&rsquo;s answers on those questions actually work. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/774088.Difficult_Conversations">Difficult Conversations</a> provides a nice framework to deal with those whys.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary">The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted a survey to determine what adults want to study. That survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the survey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It had been chosen as a typical American town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and requested to answer 156 questions-questions such as &ldquo;What is your business or profession? Your education? How do you spend your spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies? Your ambitions? Your problems? What subjects are you most interested in studying?&rdquo; And so on. That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to make people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he told me this story: &ldquo;I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to be a tragedy. She wanted love, sexual gratification, children and social prestige, but life blasted all her hopes. Her husband didn&rsquo;t love her. He refused even to eat with her and forced her to serve his meals in his room upstairs. She had no children, no social standing. She went insane; and, in her imagination, she divorced her husband and resumed her maiden name. She now believes she has married into English aristocracy, and she insists on being called Lady Smith. &ldquo;And as for children, she imagines now that she has had a new child every night. Each time I call on her she says: &lsquo;Doctor, I had a baby last night.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>

<p>Life once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality; but in the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity, all her barkentines race into port with canvas billowing and winds singing through the masts. &ldquo; Tragic? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Her physician said to me: If I could stretch out my hand and restore her sanity, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. She&rsquo;s much happier as she is.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary">When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do you think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away? It was &ldquo;lack of appreciation.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;d bet that a similar study made of runaway husbands would come out the same way. We often take our spouses so much for granted that we never let them know we appreciate them. A member of one of our classes told of a request made by his wife. She and a group of other women in her church were involved in a self-improvement program. She asked her husband to help her by listing six things he believed she could do to help her become a better wife. He reported to the class: &ldquo;I was surprised by such a request. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list six things I would like to change about her - my heavens, she could have listed a thousand things she would like to change about me - but I didn&rsquo;t. I said to her, &lsquo;Let me think about it and give you an answer in the morning.&rsquo; &ldquo;The next morning I got up very early and called the florist and had them send six red roses to my wife with a note saying: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think of six things I would like to change about you. I love you the way you are.&rsquo; &ldquo;When I arrived at home that evening, who do you think greeted me at the door: That&rsquo;s right. My wife! She was almost in tears. Needless to say, I was extremely glad I had not criticized her as she had requested.</div>

  <div class="text-secondary">Another example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our course. Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the living room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan&rsquo;s normal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he&rsquo;d just better make up his mind to go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the best frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, &ldquo;If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to kindergarten?&rdquo; He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing songs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. &ldquo;We all started finger-painting on the kitchen table-my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. Next he was begging to participate. &lsquo;Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.&rsquo; With all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand-telling him all the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair. &lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m waiting to go to kindergarten. I don&rsquo;t want to be late.&rsquo; The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.&rdquo;</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Take this one, a letter written by the head of the radio department of an advertising agency with offices scattered across the continent. This letter was sent to the managers of local radio stations throughout the country. (I have set down, in brackets, my reactions to each paragraph.)</p>

<p>Mr. John Blank, Blankville, Indiana Dear Mr. Blank:</p>

<p>The company desires to retain its position in advertising agency leadership in the radio field. [Who cares what your company desires? I am worried about my own problems. The bank is foreclosing the mortage on my house, the bugs are destroying the hollyhocks, the stock market tumbled yesterday. I missed the eight-fifteen this morning, I wasn&rsquo;t invited to the Jones&rsquo;s dance last night, the doctor tells me I have high blood pressure and neuritis and dandruff. And then what happens? I come down to the office this morning worried, open my mail and here is some little whippersnapper off in New York yapping about what his company wants. Bah! If he only realized what sort of impression his letter makes, he would get out of the advertising business and start manufacturing sheep dip.] This agency&rsquo;s national advertising accounts were the bulwark of the network. Our subsequent clearances of station time have kept us at the top of agencies year after year. [You are big and rich and right at the top, are you? So what? I don&rsquo;t give two whoops in Hades if you are as big as General Motors and General Electric and the General Staff of the U.S. Army all combined. If you had as much sense as a half-witted hummingbird, you would realize that I am interested in how big I am - not how big you are. All this talk about your enormous success makes me feel small and unimportant.] We desire to service our accounts with the last word on radio station information.[You desire! You desire. You unmitigated ass. I&rsquo;m not interested in what you desire or what the President of the United States desires. Let me tell you once and for all that I am interested in what I desire -and you haven&rsquo;t said a word about that yet in this absurd letter of yours.] Will you, therefore, put the company on your preferred list for weekly station information - every single detail that will be useful to an agency in intelligently booking time. [&ldquo;Preferred list.&rdquo; You have your nerve! You make me feel insignificant by your big talk about your company - nd then you ask me to put you on a &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; list, and you don&rsquo;t even say &ldquo;please&rdquo; when you ask it.] A prompt acknowledgment of this letter, giving us your latest &ldquo;doings,&rdquo; will be mutually helpful. [You fool! You mail me a cheap form letter - a letter scattered far and wide like the autumn leaves - and you have the gall to ask me, when I am worried about the mortgage and the hollyhocks and my blood pressure, to sit down and dictate a personal note acknowledging your form letter - and you ask me to do it &ldquo;promptly.&rdquo; What do you mean, &ldquo;promptly&rdquo;.? Don&rsquo;t you know I am just as busy as you are - or, at least, I like to think I am. And while we are on the subject, who gave you the lordly right to order me around?… You say it will be &ldquo;mutually helpful.&rdquo; At last, at last, you have begun to see my viewpoint. But you are vague about how it will be to my advantage.] Very truly yours, John Doe Manager Radio Department P.S. The enclosed reprint from the Blankville Journal will be of interest to you, and you may want to broadcast it over your station. [Finally, down here in the postscript, you mention something that may help me solve one of my problems. Why didn&rsquo;t you begin your letter with - but what&rsquo;s the use? Any advertising man who is guilty of perpetrating such drivel as you have sent me has something wrong with his medulla oblongata. You don&rsquo;t need a letter giving our latest doings. What you need is a quart of iodine in your thyroid gland.]</p>

<p>Now, if people who devote their lives to advertising and who pose as experts in the art of influencing people to buy - if they write a letter like that, what can we expect from the butcher and baker or the auto mechanic?</p>

  <div class="text-secondary">&hellip; couldn&rsquo;t get his three-year old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility. So the parents asked themselves: &ldquo;How can we make her want to do it?&rdquo; The little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put her on a chair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen while she was stirring the cereal and she said: &ldquo;Oh, look, Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.&rdquo; She ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she was interested in it. She had achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression. William Winter once remarked that &ldquo;self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.&rdquo; Why can&rsquo;t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.</div>

  <div class="text-secondary">Take the German Kaiser, for example. At the close of World War I he was probably the most savagely and universally despised man on this earth. Even his own nation turned against him when he fled over into Holland to save his neck. The hatred against him was so intense that millions of people would have loved to tear him limb from limb or burn him at the stake. In the midst of all this forest fire of fury, one little boy wrote the Kaiser a simple, sincere letter glowing with kindliness and admiration. This little boy said that no matter what the others thought, he would always love Wilhelm as his Emperor. The Kaiser was deeply touched by his letter and invited the little boy to come to see him. The boy came, so did his mother - and the Kaiser married her. That little boy didn&rsquo;t need to read a book on how to win friends and influence people. He knew how instinctively.</div>

  <div class="text-secondary">Mr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York hotel. He had called on the manager every week for four years. He went to the same social affairs the manager attended. He even took rooms in the hotel and lived there in order to get the business. But he failed.&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mr. Duvernoy, &ldquo;after studying human relations, I resolved to change my tactics. I decided to find out what interested this man - what caught his enthusiasm. &ldquo;I discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives called the Hotel Greeters of America. He not only belonged, but his bubbling enthusiasm had made him president of the organization, and president of the International Greeters. No matter where its conventions were held, he would be there. &ldquo;So when I saw him the next day, I began talking about the Greeters. What a response I got. What a response! He talked to me for half an hour about the Greeters, his tones vibrant with enthusiasm. I could plainly see that this society was not only his hobby, it was the passion of his life. Before I left his office, he had &lsquo;sold&rsquo; me a membership in his organization. &ldquo;In the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But a few days later, the steward of his hotel phoned me to come over with samples and prices. &rdquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you did to the old boy,&rsquo; the steward greeted me, &lsquo;but he sure is sold on you!&rsquo; &ldquo;Think of it! I had been drumming at that man for four years - trying to get his business - and I&rsquo;d still be drumming at him if I hadn&rsquo;t finally taken the trouble to find out what he was interested in, and what he enjoyed talking about.&rdquo;</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Never begin by announcing &ldquo;I am going to prove so-and-so to you.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s bad. That&rsquo;s tantamount to saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smarter than you are, I&rsquo;m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want to battle with you before you even start.</p>

<p>It is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change people&rsquo;s minds. So why make it harder? Why handicap yourself?</p>

<p>If you are going to prove anything, don&rsquo;t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope:</p>

<p>Men must be taught as if you taught them not<br>
And things unknown proposed as things forgot.</p>

<p>Over three hundred years ago Galileo said: You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.</p>

<p>As Lord Chesterfield said to his son: Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.</p>

<p>Socrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens:One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing. Well,</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit telling people they are wrong. And I find that it pays.</p>

<p>If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong - yes, even that you know is wrong - isn&rsquo;t it better to begin by saying: &ldquo;Well, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let&rsquo;s examine the facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: &ldquo;I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let&rsquo;s examine the facts.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Katherine A, Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, is an industrial engineering supervisor for a yarn-processing plant. She told one of our classes how she handled a sensitive problem before and after taking our training:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Part of my responsibility,&rdquo; she reported, &ldquo;deals with setting up and maintaining incentive systems and standards for our operators so they can make more money by producing more yarn. The system we were using had worked fine when we had only two or three different types of yarn, but recently we had expanded our inventory and capabilities to enable us to run more than twelve different varieties. The present system was no longer adequate to pay the operators fairly for the work being performed and give them an incentive to increase production. I had worked up a new system which would enable us to pay the operator by the class of yam she was running at any one particular time. With my new system in hand, I entered the meeting determined to prove to the management that my system was the right approach. I told them in detail how they were wrong and showed where they were being unfair and how I had all the answers they needed. To say the least, I failed miserably! I had become so busy defending my position on the new system that I had left them no opening to graciously admit their problems on the old one. The issue was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After several sessions of this course, I realized all too well where I had made my mistakes. I called another meeting and this time I asked where they felt their problems were. We discussed each point, and I asked them their opinions on which was the best way to proceed. With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I let them develop my system themselves. At the end of the meeting when I actually presented my system, they enthusiastically accepted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Martin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he could be an admirer of Air Force General Daniel &ldquo;Chappie&rdquo; James, then the nation&rsquo;s highest-ranking black officer. Dr. King replied, &ldquo;I judge people by their own s - not by my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the most glowing terms about a certain officer under his command. Another officer in attendance was astonished. &ldquo;General,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo; do you not know that the man of whom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies who misses no opportunity to malign you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied General Lee, &ldquo;but the president asked my opinion of him; he did not ask for his opinion of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the way, I am not revealing anything new in this chapter. Two thousand years ago, Jesus said: &ldquo;Agree with thine adversary quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice - advice that is sorely needed today. &ldquo;Be diplomatic,&rdquo; counseled the King. &ldquo;It will help you gain your point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In other words, don&rsquo;t argue with your customer or your spouse or your adversary. Don&rsquo;t tell them they are wrong, don&rsquo;t get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary">The skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; responses. This sets the psychological process of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force to send it back in the opposite direction. The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says &ldquo;No&rdquo; and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism - glandular, nervous, muscular -gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward - moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more &ldquo;Yeses&rdquo; we can, at the very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary">Socrates, &ldquo;the gadfly of Athens,&rdquo; was one of the greatest philosophers the world has ever known. He did something that only a handful of men in all history have been able to do: he sharply changed the whole course of human thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his death, he is honored as one of the wisest persuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world. His method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh, no, not Socrates. He was far too adroit for that. His whole technique, now called the &ldquo;Socratic method,&rdquo; was based upon getting a &ldquo;yes, yes&rdquo; response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously. The next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, let&rsquo;s remember old Socrates and ask a gentle question - a question that will get the &ldquo;yes, yes&rdquo; response. The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of the Orient: &ldquo;He who treads softly goes far.&rdquo; They have spent five thousand years studying human nature, those cultured Chinese, and they have garnered a lot of perspicacity: &ldquo;He who treads softly goes far.&rdquo;</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary">A large advertisement appeared on the financial page of a New York newspaper calling for a person with unusual ability and experience. Charles T. Cubellis answered the advertisement, sending his reply to a box number. A few days later, he was invited by letter to call for an interview. Before he called, he spent hours in Wall Street finding out everything possible about the person who had founded the business. During the interview, he remarked: &ldquo;I should be mighty proud to be associated with an organization with a record like yours. I understand you started twenty-eight years ago with nothing but desk room and one stenographer. Is that true?&rdquo; Almost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early struggles. This man was no exception. He talked for a long time about how he had started with $450 in cash and an original idea. He told how he had fought against discouragement and battled against ridicule, working Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen hours a day; how he had finally won against all odds until now the most important executives on Wall Street were coming to him for information and guidance. He was proud of such a record. He had a right to be, and he had a splendid time telling about it. Finally, he questioned Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then called in one of his vice presidents and said: &ldquo;I think this is the person we are looking for.&rdquo;</div>

Drifting into the President&rsquo;s private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of his secretaries, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty dress you are wearing this morning, and you are a very attractive young woman.&rdquo; That was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever bestowed upon a secretary in his life. It was so unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge said, &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get stuck up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on, I wish you would be a little bit more careful with your Punctuation.&rdquo; His method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was superb. It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary">Simply changing one three-letter word can often spell the difference between failure and success in changing people without giving offense or arousing resentment. Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; and ending with a critical statement. For example, in trying to change a child&rsquo;s careless attitude toward studies, we might say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term. But if you had worked harder on your algebra, the results would have been better.&rdquo; In this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he heard the word &ldquo;but.&rdquo; He might then question the sincerity of the original praise. To him, the praise seemed only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical inference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably would not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie&rsquo;s attitude toward his studies. This could be easily overcome by changing the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; to &ldquo;and.&rdquo;</div>

  <div class="text-secondary">Calling attention to one&rsquo;s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism. Marge Jacob of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, told one of our classes how she convinced some sloppy construction workers to clean up after themselves when they were building additions to her house. For the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob returned from her job, she noticed that the yard was strewn with the cut ends of lumber. She didn&rsquo;t want to antagonize the builders, because they did excellent work. So after the workers had gone home, she and her children picked up and neatly piled all the lumber debris in a corner. The following morning she called the foreman to one side and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really pleased with the way the front lawn was left last night; it is nice and clean and does not offend the neighbors.&rdquo; From that day forward the workers picked up and piled the debris to one side, and the foreman came in each day seeking approval of the condition the lawn was left in after a day&rsquo;s work.</div>

  <div class="text-secondary">On March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher died. The following Sunday, Lyman Abbott was invited to speak in the pulpit left silent by Beecher&rsquo;s passing. Eager to do his best, he wrote, rewrote and polished his sermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert. Then he read it to his wife. It was poor - as most written speeches are. She might have said, if she had had less judgment, &ldquo;Lyman, that is terrible. That&rsquo;ll never do. You&rsquo;ll put people to sleep. It reads like an encyclopedia. You ought to know better than that after all the years you have been preaching. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, why don&rsquo;t you talk like a human being? Why don&rsquo;t you act natural? You&rsquo;ll disgrace yourself if you ever read that stuff.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what she might have said. And, if she had, you know what would have happened. And she knew too. So, she merely remarked that it would make an excellent article for the North American Review. In other words, she praised it and at the same time subtly suggested that it wouldn&rsquo;t do as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the point, tore up his carefully prepared manuscript and preached without even using notes.</div>

  <div class="text-secondary">Admitting one&rsquo;s own mistakes - even when one hasn&rsquo;t corrected them - can help convince somebody to change his behavior. This was illustrated more recently by Clarence Zerhusen of Timonium, Maryland, when he discovered his fifteen-year-old son was experimenting with cigarettes. &ldquo;Naturally, I didn&rsquo;t want David to smoke,&rdquo; Mr. Zerhusen told us, &ldquo;but his mother and I smoked cigarettes; we were giving him a bad example all the time. I explained to Dave how I started smoking at about his age and how the nicotine had gotten the best of me and now it was nearly impossible for me to stop. I reminded him how irritating my cough was and how he had been after me to give up cigarettes not many years before.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exhort him to stop or make threats or warn him about their dangers. All I did was point out how I was hooked on cigarettes and what it had meant to me. &ldquo;He thought about it for a while and decided he wouldn&rsquo;t smoke until he had graduated from high school. As the years went by David never did start smoking and has no intention of ever doing so. &ldquo;As a result of that conversation I made the decision to stop smoking cigarettes myself, and with the support of my family, I have succeeded.&rdquo;</div>

Fred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident that occurred in his company: &ldquo;At one of our production meetings, a vice president was asking very pointed questions of one of our production supervisors regarding a production process. His tone of voice was aggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty performance on the part of the supervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed in front of his peers, the supervisor was evasive in his responses. This caused the vice president to lose his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse him of lying. &ldquo;Any working relationship that might have existed prior to this encounter was destroyed in a few brief moments. This supervisor, who was basically a good worker, was useless to our company from that time on. A few months later he left our firm and went to work for a competitor, where I understand he is doing a fine job.&rdquo;</div>

  <div class="text-secondary">One morning Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin, Ireland, was shocked when one of his patients pointed out to him that the metal cup holder which she was using to rinse her mouth was not very clean. True, the patient drank from the paper cup, not the holder, but it certainly was not professional to use tarnished equipment. When the patient left, Dr. Fitzhugh retreated to his private office to write a note to Bridgit, the charwoman, who came twice a week to clean his office. He wrote: My dear Bridgit, I see you so seldom, I thought I&rsquo;d take the time to thank you for the fine job of cleaning you&rsquo;ve been doing. By the way, I thought I&rsquo;d mention that since two hours, twice a week, is a very limited amount of time, please feel free to work an extra half hour from time to time if you feel you need to do those &ldquo;once-in-a-while&rdquo; things like polishing the cup holders and the like. I, of course, will pay you for the extra time. &ldquo;The next day, when I walked into my office,&rdquo; Dr. Fitzhugh reported, &ldquo;My desk had been polished to a mirror-like finish, as had my chair, which I nearly slid out of. When I went into the treatment room I found the shiniest, cleanest chrome-plated cup holder I had ever seen nestled in its receptacle. I had given my char-woman a fine reputation to live up to, and because of this small gesture she outperformed all her past efforts. How much additional time did she spend on this? That&rsquo;s right-none at all.&rdquo;</div>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Try this yourself. The next time you are in a strange city, stop someone who is below you in the economic and social scale and say: &ldquo;I wonder if you would mind helping me out of a little difficulty. Won&rsquo;t you please tell me how to get to such and such a place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin used this technique to turn a caustic enemy into a lifelong friend. Franklin, a young man at the time, had all his savings invested in a small printing business. He managed to get himself elected clerk of the General Assembly in Philadelphia. That position gave him the job of doing the official printing. There was good profit in this job, and Ben was eager to keep it. But a menace loomed ahead. One of the richest and ablest men in the Assembly disliked Franklin bitterly. He not only disliked Franklin, but he denounced him in a public talk. That was dangerous, very dangerous. So Franklin resolved to make the man like him. But how? That was a problem. By doing a favour for his enemy? No, that would have aroused his suspicions, maybe his contempt. Franklin was too wise, too adroit to be caught in such a trap. So he did the very opposite. He asked his enemy to do him a favour.Franklin didn&rsquo;t ask for a loan of ten dollars. No! No! Franklin asked a favour that pleased the other man-a favour that touched his vanity, a favour that gave him recognition, a favour that subtly expressed Franklin&rsquo;s admiration for his knowledge and achievements. Here is the balance of the story in Franklin&rsquo;s own words: Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book and requesting that he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I returned it in about a week with another note expressing strongly my sense of the favour. When next we met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before) and with great civility and he ever afterward manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends and our friendship continued to his death.</p>

<p>Ben Franklin has been dead now for a hundred and fifty years, but the psychology that he used, the psychology of asking the other man to do you a favour, goes marching right on.</p>

Forcing her way into his study, she stormed at him and abused him. Napoleon, master of a dozen sumptuous palaces, Emperor of France, could not find a cupboard in which he could call his soul his own. And what did Eugenic accomplish by all this? Here is the answer. I am quoting now from E.A. Rheinhardt&rsquo;s engrossing book, Napoleon and Eugenic: The Tragicomedy of an Empire: &ldquo;So it came about that Napoleon frequently would steal out by a little side door at night, with a soft hat pulled over his eyes, and, accompanied by one of his intimates, really betake himself to some fair lady who was expecting him, or else stroll about the great city as of old, passing through streets of the kind which an Emperor hardly sees outside a fairy tale, and breathing the atmosphere of might-have-beens.&ldquo;That is what nagging accomplished for Eugenic. True, she sat on the throne of France. True, she was the most beautiful woman in the world. But neither royalty nor beauty can keep love alive amidst the poisonous fumes of nagging. Eugenic could have raised her voice like Job of old and have wailed: &ldquo;The thing which I greatly feared is come upon me.&rdquo; Come upon her? She brought it upon herself, poor woman, by her jealousy and her nagging. Of all the sure-fire, infernal devices ever invented by all the devils in hell for destroying love, nagging is the deadliest. It never fails. Like the bite of the king cobra, it always destroys, always kills.</div>

When Booth fired, Lincoln never realized he had been shot; but he reaped almost daily, for twenty-three years, what Herndon, his law partner, described as &ldquo;the bitter harvest of conjugal infelicity.&rdquo; &ldquo;Conjugal infelicity?&rdquo; That is putting it mildly. For almost a quarter of a century, Mrs Lincoln nagged and harassed the life out of him. She was always complaining, always criticizing her husband; nothing about him was ever right. He was stoop-shouldered, he walked awkwardly and lifted his feet straight up and down like an Indian. She complained that there was no spring in his step, no grace to his movement; and she mimicked his gait and nagged at him to walk with his toes pointed down, as she had been taught at Madame Mentelle&rsquo;s boarding school in Lexington. She didn&rsquo;t like the way his huge ears stood out at right angles from his head. She even told him that his nose wasn&rsquo;t straight, that his lower lip stuck out, and he looked consumptive, that his feet and hands were too large, his head too small.</div>

  <div class="text-secondary">One morning Mr and Mrs Lincoln were having breakfast when Lincoln did something that aroused the fiery temper of his wife. What, no one remembers now. But Mrs Lincoln, in a rage, dashed a cup of hot coffee into her husband&rsquo;s face. And she did it in front of the other boarders. Saying nothing, Lincoln sat there in humiliation and silence while Mrs Early came with a wet towel and wiped off his face and clothes. Mrs Lincoln&rsquo;s jealousy was so foolish, so fierce, so incredible, that merely to read about some of the pathetic and disgraceful scenes she created in public-merely reading about them seventy-five years later makes one gasp with astonishment. She finally went insane; and perhaps the most charitable thing one can say about her is that her disposition was probably always affected by incipient insanity. Did all this nagging and scolding and raging change Lincoln? In one way, yes. It certainly changed his attitude toward her. It made him regret his unfortunate marriage, and it made him avoid her presence as much as possible.</div>
