<p>The code should look as a sentence said by a domain expert. That’s the core idea. The rest is a lengthy guide to listening to domain experts and mapping their sayings to the code.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brilliant idea, totally worth knowing</li>
<li>I could finally understand most of the content on Fowler’s blog</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s very hard to follow the author. If I haven’t seen DDD in practice, the book wouldn’t make sense to me at all.</li>
<li>It has no warnings about the wrong application of this approach. See <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html">Anemic Domain Model</a> as an example.</li>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>In a TV talk show interview, comedian John Cleese told a story of an event during the filming of “Monty
Python and the Holy Grail”. They had been shooting a particular scene over and over, but somehow it
wasn’t funny. Finally, he took a break and consulted with fellow comedian Michael Palin (the other actor in
the scene), and they came up with a slight variation. They shot one more take, and it turned out funny, so
they called it a day.</p>
<p>The next morning Mr. Cleese was looking at the rough cut the film editor had put together of the previous
day’s work. Coming to the scene they had struggled with, he found that it wasn’t funny; one of the earlier
takes had been used.</p>
<p>He asked the film editor why he hadn’t used the last take, as directed.  “Couldn’t use it. Someone walked
in-shot,” the editor replied. Mr. Cleese watched the scene again, and then again. Still he could see nothing
wrong. Finally the editor stopped the film and pointed out a coat sleeve that was visible for a moment at the
edge of the picture.</p>
<p>The film editor was concerned that other film editors who saw the movie would judge his work based on its
technical perfection. He was focused on the precise execution of his own specialty, and, in the process, the
heart of the scene had been lost. [“The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn”, CBS, September, 2001]
Fortunately, the funny scene was restored by a director who understood comedy. In just the same way,
leaders within a team who understand the centrality of the domain can put their software project back on
course when enthusiastic developers get caught up in develop elaborate technical frameworks that do not
serve, or actually get in the way of domain development, while development of a model that reflects deep
understanding of the domain is lost in the shuffle.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>In the old waterfall method, the business experts talked to the analysts, analysts digested and abstracted and
passed the result along to the programmers who coded the software. This failed because it completely lacks
feedback. The analysts have full responsibility for creating the model based only on input from the business
experts. They have no opportunity to learn from the programmers or gain experience with early versions.
Knowledge trickles in one direction, but does not accumulate.</p>
<p>Other projects have iteration, but don’t build up knowledge because they don’t abstract. They get the
experts to describe a desired feature and they go build it. They show the experts the result and ask them
what to do next. If the programmers practice refactoring they can keep the software clean enough to
continue extending it, but if programmers are not interested in the domain, they only learn what the
application should do, not the principles behind it. Useful software can be built that way, but the project
will never gain the kind of leverage where powerful new features unfold as corollaries to older features.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>One of the projects that I’ll be drawing on for examples throughout the book was a container shipping
system. Since the beginning of a shipment is booking cargo, we developed a model that allowed us to
describe the cargo, its itinerary, and so on. This was all necessary and useful, yet the domain experts felt
dissatisfied. There was a way they looked at their business that we were missing.</p>
<p>Eventually, we realized that our focus on the handling of cargo, the physical loading and unloading, the
movements from place to place, was largely handled by subcontractors or by operational people in the
company. The view of our customers was of a series of transfers of responsibility between parties. A
process governed transfer of legal and practical responsibility from the shipper to some local carrier, from
one carrier to another, and to the consignee. Often, the cargo would sit in a warehouse while important
steps were being taken. At other times, the cargo would move through complex physical steps that were not
relevant to shipping company’s business decisions. Rather than the logistical emphasis of the itinerary,
what came to the fore was legal documents like the bill of lading, and processes leading to release of
payments.</p>
<p>This deeper view of the shipping business did not mean there was no itinerary object, but the model
changed profoundly. Our view of shipping changed from moving containers from place to place, to
transferring responsibility for cargo from entity to entity. Features for handling these transfers of
responsibility were no longer awkwardly attached to loading operations, but were supported by a model
that came out of an understanding of the significant relationship between those operations and those
responsibilities.</p>
<p>Knowledge crunching is an exploration, and you can’t know where you will end up.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Although it has never reached the mass usage that object-oriented languages have, the Prolog language is a
natural fit for MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN. In this case, the paradigm is logic, and the model is a set of logical
rules and facts they operate on.</p>
<p>MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN has limited applicability using languages like C because there is no modeling
paradigm that corresponds to a purely procedural language. Those languages are “procedural”, in the sense
that the programmer tells the computer a series of steps to follow. While the programmer may be thinking
about the concepts of the domain, the program itself is a series of technical manipulations of data. The
result may be useful, but the program doesn’t capture much of the meaning. Procedural languages often
support complex data types that begin to correspond to more natural conceptions of the domain, but these
complex types are only organized data, and don’t capture the active aspects of the domain. The result is that
software is written as complicated functions linked together based on anticipated paths of execution, rather
than by conceptual connections in the domain model.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the event is “general admission”, meaning ticket-holders sit wherever they find an

Although the seat numbers are still engraved on the physical seats, there is no need for the software to track
them, and, in fact, it would be an error in the model to associate specific seat numbers with tickets, since
there is no such constraint at the event. Then seats are not ENTITIES, and no identifier is needed.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>To address this, schemes have been developed for defining ownership relationships in the model along with
a set of rules for implementing transactions that modify the objects and their owners. David Siegel
developed the following simple but rigorous system, distilled from those concepts, in the mid 1990s</p>
<p>First we need an abstraction for encapsulating references within the model. An AGGREGATE is a cluster of
associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose of data changes. Each AGGREGATE has a root and a
boundary.  The boundary defines what is inside the AGGREGATE. The root is a single specific ENTITY
contained in the AGGREGATE. The root is the only member of the AGGREGATE that outside objects are
allowed to hold references to, although objects within the boundary may hold references to each other.
ENTITIES other than the root have local identity, but it only needs to be unique within the aggregate, since
no outside object can ever see it out of the context of the root ENTITY.</p>
<p>A model of a car might be used in software for an auto repair shop. The car is an ENTITY with global
identity – we want to distinguish that car from all other cars in the world, even very similar ones. We can
use the Vehicle Identification Number for this, a unique identifier assigned to each new car. We might want
to track the rotation history of the tires through the four wheel positions. We might want to know mileage
and tread wear of each tire. To know which tire is which, the tires must be identified ENTITIES also. But it is
very unlikely that we care about the identity of those tires outside of the context of that particular car. If we
replace the tires and send the old ones to a recycling plant, either our software will no longer track them at
all, or they will become anonymous members of a heap of tires. No one will care about their rotation
histories. More to the point, even while they are attached to the car, no one will try to query the system to
find a particular tire and then see which car it is on. They will query the database to find a car and then ask
it for a transient reference to the tires. Therefore, the car is the root ENTITY of the AGGREGATE whose
boundary encloses the tires also.  On the other hand, engine blocks have serial numbers engraved on them
and are sometimes tracked independently of the car.  In some applications, the engine might be the root of
its own AGGREGATE.</p>

client knows what job needs to be done and relies on the domain objects to carrying out the necessary
computations. It should not reflect any understanding of how the task is done or the internal nature of the
object doing it. If the client is expected to assemble the domain objects it needs, it must know something
about the internal structure of the object. In order to enforce all the invariants that apply to the relationship
of parts in the domain object it must know some of the object’s rules. Even calling constructors couples the
client to the concrete classes of the objects it is building. No change to the implementation of the domain
objects can be made without changing the client, making refactoring harder.</p>
<p>A client taking on object creation becomes unnecessarily complicated and blurs its responsibility. It
breaches the encapsulation of the domain objects and AGGREGATES being created. Even worse, if the client
is part of the application layer, then responsibilities have leaked out of the domain layer altogether. This
tight coupling of the application to the specifics of the implementation, strips away most of the benefits of
abstraction in the domain layer, and makes continuing changes ever more expensive.</p>
<p>Creation of an object can be a major operation in itself, but complex assembly operations do not fit

designs that are hard to understand. Shifting the responsibility of directing construction to the client

</code></pre></div><p>This code was written to be as simple as possible.  As I said, there may be situations in which this is
inefficient. However, other implementation options are possible that would minimize object count or boost
speed, or perhaps be compatible with idiosyncratic technologies present in some project. The important
thing is a model that captures the key concepts of the domain, along with an implementation that is faithful
to that model. That leaves a lot of room to solve performance problems.</p>
<p>There are also cases where this full generality is not needed. In particular, &ldquo;and&rdquo; tends to be used a lot more
than the others, and also tends to create less implementation complexity.  Don&rsquo;t be afraid to implement only
&ldquo;and&rdquo;, if that is all you need.</p>

interdependence of parts and improve clarity and ease of understanding and analysis without reducing their
interoperability and synergy. It must also capture the conceptual core of the system, the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; of the

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>BOUNDED CONTEXT, the least obvious of the principles, is actually the most fundamental. A successful
model, large or small, has to be logically consistent throughout, without any contradictory or overlapping
definitions.  Enterprise systems sometimes integrate subsystems with varying origins or have applications
so distinct that very little in the domain is viewed in the same light.  It may be asking too much to unify the
models implicit in these disparate parts.  By explicitly defining a BOUNDED CONTEXT within which a model
applies, and then, when necessary, defining its relationship with other contexts, the modeler can avoid
bastardizing the model.</p>
<p>DISTILLATION reduces the clutter and focuses the attention appropriately.  Often a great deal of effort is
spent on peripheral issues in the domain. The overall domain model needs to make prominent the most
value-adding and special aspects of your system and be structured to give that part as much power as
possible. While some supporting components are critical, they must be put into their proper perspective.
This not only helps to direct efforts toward vital parts of the system, but it keeps the vision of the system
from being lost. DISTILLATION can bring clarity to an overall model. And with a clearer view the design of
the core can be made more useful.</p>
<p>LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE completes the picture. In a very complex model, you may not see the forest for
the trees. Distillation helps, by focusing the attention on the core and presenting the other elements in their
supporting roles, but the relationships can still be too confusing without some LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE
that allows system-wide design elements and patterns to be applied. I’ll overview a few approaches to large
scale structure and then go into depth on one such pattern, RESPONSIBILITY LAYERS, in which a small set of
fundamental responsibilities are identified that can be organized into layers with defined relationships
between layers, such as modes of communication and allowed references. These are examples of LARGE
SCALE STRUCTURES, not a comprehensive catalog. New ones should be invented when needed. Some such
structure can bring a uniformity to the design that can accelerate the design process and improve
integration.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Total unification of the domain model for a large system will not be feasible or cost-effective.
Sometimes people fight this. Most people see the price that multiple models exact by limiting integration
and making communication cumbersome. On top of that, it somehow seems inelegant. This resistance to
multiple models sometimes leads to very ambitious attempts to unify all the software in a large project
under a single model. I know I’ve been guilty of this kind of overreaching. Consider the risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Too many legacy replacements may be attempted at once.</li>
<li>Large projects may bog down because the coordination overhead exceeds their abilities.</li>
<li>Applications with specialized needs may have to use models that don’t fully satisfy their needs,
forcing them to put behavior elsewhere.</li>
<li>Conversely, attempting to satisfy everyone with a single model may lead to complex options that
make the model difficult to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s more, model divergences are as likely to come from political fragmentation and differing
management priorities as from technical concerns. And the emergence of different models can be a result of
team organization and development process. So even when no technical factor prevents full integration, the
project may still face multiple models.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>A model applies in a context. This may be a certain part of the code, or the work of a particular team. For a
model invented in a brainstorming session, the context could be limited to that particular conversation. The
context of a model used in an example in this book is that particular example section and any discussion of
it. The model context is whatever set of conditions must apply in order to be able to say that the terms in a
model have a specific meaning.</p>
<p>To begin to solve the problems of multiple models, we need to explicitly define the scope of a particular
model as a bounded part of a software system within which a single model will apply and will be kept as
unified as possible. This has to be reconciled with the team organization.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>Explicitly define the context within which a model applies. Explicitly set boundaries in terms of team
organization, usage within specific parts of the application, and physical manifestations such as code
bases and database schemas. Keep the model strictly consistent within these bounds, but don’t be
distracted or confused by issues outside.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Combining elements of distinct models causes two categories of problems: duplicate concepts and false
cognates. Duplication of concepts means that there are two model elements (and attendant
implementations) that actually represent the same concept. Every time this information changes, it has to be
updated in two places with conversions. Every time new knowledge leads to a change in one of the objects,
the other has to be reanalyzed and changed too. Except the reanalysis doesn’t happen in reality, so the
result is two versions of the same concept that follow different rules and even have different data. On top of
that, the team members must learn not one but two ways of doing the same thing, along with all the ways
they are being synchronized.</p>
<p>False cognates may be slightly less common, but more insidiously harmful. This is the case when two
people who are using the same term (or implemented object) think they are talking about the same thing,
but really are not. The example in the introduction (two different business activities both called a “charge”)
is typical, but conflicts can be even subtler when the two definitions are actually related to the same aspect
in the domain, but have been conceptualized in slightly different ways. False cognates lead to development
teams that step on each other’s code, databases that have weird contradictions, and confusion in
communication within the team. The term “false cognate” is ordinarily applied to natural languages.
English speakers learning Spanish often misuse the word “embarasada”. This word does not mean
“embarrassed”; it means “pregnant”. Oops.</p>

<p>It is usually not practical to hire short-term outside design expertise to help in the nuts and bolts of creating
the CORE DOMAIN because the team needs to accumulate domain knowledge, and a temporary member is a

helping the team build its domain design skills and facilitating the use of sophisticated principles that team

value the application will bring to the organization.  Some of these describe the creation of the domain
model as a strategic asset.  Usually the vision statement document is abandoned after the project gets
funding, and is never used in the actual development process or even read by the technical staff.</p>
<p>These documents, or closely related ones that emphasize the nature of the domain model, can be used
directly by the management and technical staff during all phases of development to guide resource
allocation, to guide modeling choices, and to educate team members. If the domain model serves many
masters, you can use this document to show how their interests are balanced.</p>
<p>Write a short (~1 page) description of the CORE DOMAIN and the value it will bring, the “value
proposition”.  Ignore those aspects that do not distinguish this domain model from others. Show how
the domain model serves and balances diverse interests. Keep it narrow.  Write this statement early
and revise it as you gain new insight.</p>

<li>Wherever it is hurting. I’ll refactor what I need to in order to get my specific task done.
I don’t hold with either of these. The first is impractical except in a few projects staffed entirely with top

shying away from the worst tangles. Eventually the code becomes harder and harder to refactor.</li>

<ol>
<li>In a pain-driven refactoring, you look to see if the root involves the CORE DOMAIN or the

<ul>
<li>Potential: What can be done? Never mind what we are planning to do. What could we do?  The
resources of  the organization, including its people, and the way those resources are organized are the
core of potential. Contracts with vendors also define potentials. This layer could be recognized in
almost any business domain, but is a prominent part of the story in those, like transportation and
manufacturing, that have a relatively large fixed capital investments that enable the business. Potential
includes transient assets, as well, but a business primarily driven by transient assets might choose
layers that emphasize this, as we’ll see later.</li>
<li>Operation: What is being done? What have we managed to make of those potentials? Like Potential,
this should reflect the reality of the situation, rather than what we want it to be. In this layer we are
trying to see our own efforts and activities: What we are selling, rather than what enables us to sell. It
is very typical of Operational objects to reference or even be composed of Potential objects, while a
potential object shouldn’t reference the operations layer.</li>

  <div class="text-secondary">The need for user control of the rules for associating objects drove the team to a model
that had an implicit KNOWLEDGE LEVEL. KNOWLEDGE LEVEL was hinted at by the
characteristic access restrictions and a thing-thing type relationship. Once it was in place,
the clarity it afforded helped produce another insight that disentangled two important
domain concepts.</div>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>When you are tackling the strategic design for the first time on a project, where do you start? Strategically,
the most important thing is to start from a clear assessment of the current situation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw a CONTEXT MAP. Can you draw a consistent one or are there ambiguous situations?</li>
<li>Attend to the use of language on the project. Is there a UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE? Is it rich enough
to help development?</li>
<li>Understand what is important. Is the CORE DOMAIN identified? Is there a DOMAIN VISION
STATEMENT? Can you write one?</li>
<li>Does the technology of the project work for or against a MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN?</li>
<li>Do the developers on the team have the necessary technical skills?</li>
<li>Are the developers knowledgeable about the domain? Are they interested in the domain.</li>
