<p>Names and reputation influence us. And symbols of power or status like titles,
possessions, rank, uniforms, or a nice suit and tie. For example, in one study 22
hospital nurses got a telephone call from an unknown physician and were ordered
to administer an obvious overdose of an unauthorized drug. All but one nurse
obeyed.
Another example is when advertisers use famous people to endorse their
products. But being famous doesn&rsquo;t give people special expertise.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>In one experiment at Yale University, Psychology Professor Stanley Milgram
tricked people by posing as an authority and caused normal people to impose
what they had every reason to believe was intense pain to other people. The
participants in the experiment were instructed to shock another person if they
answered a question wrong. No real pain was delivered during the experiment.</p>
<p>But it showed that when we are given orders from what we believe to be a
legitimate authority, we obey even if the result is that we end up hurting others.
In later studies Milgram showed that obedience was maximized by first observing
peers obey but dramatically reduced when peers rebelled, or when the victim
acted like a masochist asking to be shocked. Milgram said in Obedience to
Authority: &ldquo;It is psychologically easy to ignore responsibility when one is only an
immediate link in a chain of evil action&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Below is a list of 28 reasons for misjudgments and mistakes. It can be used as
a checklist to explain or predict behavior or as a pilot&rsquo;s checklist to avoid fooling
ourselves. Each item on the list will be explained in the next chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bias from mere association - automatically connecting a stimulus with pain
or pleasure; including liking or disliking something associated with
something bad or good. Includes seeing situations as identical because they
seem similar. Also bias from Persian Messenger Syndrome - not wanting to
be the carrier of bad news.</li>
<li>Underestimating the power of rewards and punishment - people repeat
actions that result in rewards and avoid actions that they are punished for.</li>
<li>Underestimating bias from own self-interest and incentives.</li>
<li>Self-serving bias - overly positive view of our abilities and future. Includes over-optimism.</li>
<li>Self-deception and denial- distortion of reality to reduce pain or increase
pleasure. Includes wishful thinking.</li>
<li>Bias from consistency tendency - being consistent with our prior
commitments and ideas even when acting against our best interest or in the
face of disconfirming evidence. Includes confirmation bias - looking for
evidence that confirms our actions and beliefs and ignoring or distorting
disconfirming evidence.</li>
<li>Bias from deprival syndrome - strongly reacting (including desiring and
valuing more) when something we like and have (or almost have) is (or
threatens to be) taken away or &ldquo;lost.&rdquo; Includes desiring and valuing more
what we can&rsquo;t have or what is (or threatens to be) less available.</li>
<li>Status quo bias and do-nothing syndrome - keeping things the way they are.
Includes minimizing effort and a preference for default options.</li>
<li>Impatience - valuing the present more highly than the future.</li>
<li>Bias from envy and jealousy.</li>
<li>Distortion by contrast comparison - judging and perceiving the absolute
magnitude of something not by itself but based only on its difference to
something else presented closely in time or space or to some earlier
adaptation level. Also underestimating the consequences over time of
gradual changes.</li>
<li>Bias from anchoring - over-weighing certain initial information as a
reference point for future decisions.</li>
<li>Over-influence by vivid or the most recent information.</li>
<li>Omission and abstract blindness - only seeing stimuli we encounter or that
grabs our attention, and neglecting important missing information or the
abstract. Includes inattentional blindness.</li>
<li>Bias from reciprocation tendency - repaying in kind what others have done
for or to us like favors, concessions, information and attitudes.</li>
<li>Bias from over-influence by liking tendency - believing, trusting and
agreeing with people we know and like. Includes bias from over-desire for
liking and social acceptance and for avoiding social disapproval. Also bias
from disliking - our tendency to avoid and disagree with people we don&rsquo;t
like.</li>
<li>Bias from over-influence by social proof - imitating the behavior of many
others or similar others. Includes crowd folly.</li>
<li>Bias from over-influence by authority - trusting and obeying a perceived
authority or expert.</li>
<li>Sensemaking - Constructing explanations that fit an outcome. Includes
being too quick in drawing conclusions. Also thinking events that have
happened were more predictable than they were.</li>
<li>Reason-respecting - complying with requests merely because we&rsquo;ve been
given a reason. Includes underestimating the power in giving people reasons.</li>
<li>Believing first and doubting later - believing what is not true, especially
when distracted.</li>
<li>Memory limitations - remembering selectively and wrong. Includes
influence by suggestions.</li>
<li>Do-something syndrome - acting without a sensible reason.</li>
<li>Mental confusion from say-something syndrome - feeling a need to say
something when we have nothing to say.</li>
<li>Emotional arousal- making hasty judgments under the influence of intense
emotions. Includes exaggerating the emotional impact of future events.</li>
<li>Mental confusion from stress.</li>
<li>Mental confusion from physical or psychological pain, the influence of
chemicals or diseases.</li>
<li>Bias from over-influence by the combined effect of many psychological
tendencies operating together.</li>

sell the car $1,000 below the competition. Then the salesman changed the terms. He
had discovered an error. In the end, the price ended up $200 above competition.
In the low-ball technique, the salesperson gives the customer an incentive to enter
into an agreement with the intention of changing the terms to the seller&rsquo;s
advantage (either by removing the advantage or adding something undesirable).
Once John made the decision and took the time and effort to buy a new car, he
committed to the purchase. Otherwise he would appear inconsistent. Instead of
backing out of the deal, he found new reasons to justify his purchase of the car.
Low-ball is often used by politicians in elections.</div>

That&rsquo;s because a lot of people start out with 400-horsepower motors and get a hundred
horsepower of output. It&rsquo;s way better to have a 200-horsepower motor and get it all into

scurvy - because they might mutiny and take over the ship if they thought that he was
taking them on a voyage so long that scurvy was likely.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what he did: Officers ate one place where the men could observe them. And
for a long time, he served sauerkraut to the officers, but not to the men. And then, finally,
Captain Cook said, &ldquo;Well, the men can have it one day a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In due course, he had the whole crew eating sauerkraut. I regard that as a very
constructive use of elementary psychology. It may have saved God knows how many lives

&hellip; Arco was celebrating their huge triumph of making a lot of money out of the North
Slope oilfields in Alaska. And the house counsel there was an Irishman who was very
outspoken and had a fair amount of charm. And he was highly regarded. So he could get
by with talking frankly. And the whole group was toasting one another: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we great
people for having done this great thing?&rdquo; and this Irish house counsel raised his glass and
said &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to toast the man who really caused our triumph.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to
King Faisal &hellip; Every calculation we made was offby 200%. All the costs were way higher,
and the difficulties way greater than we ever conceived. All the predictions we made were
totally asinine and wouldn&rsquo;t have worked with the oil prices we ptojected. But along came
King Faisal and the oil cartel and raised the price of oil so high that they made us all look
good. Let&rsquo;s honor the proper man here tonight. &quot;</p>
<p>This is the kind of toast you will seldom hear in corporate life - because for most people,
a toast like that will get you fired. And a guy who&rsquo;s bringing reality into a pleasant party,
and making people face their own limitations and errors, will have poor prospects</p>

only have time and money to invest in one project. Which one are they most
likely to pick? Of course, the one that looks most attractive. But all division
managers have an incentive to make their own project the most attractive one.
The risk is therefore that TransCorp chooses the project with the most optimistic

  <div class="text-secondary">An example of statistical misuse is from 1992 when it was reported that 28
teenagers who frequently played the game of &ldquo;Dungeons and Dragons&rdquo;
committed suicide. What conclusion should be drawn? Is there a link between
teenage suicide and the game?
The American mathematician John Allen Paulos tells us in Innumeracy to put
this statement into the right perspective by considering two more facts. The game
sold millions of copies and about 3 million teenagers played it. In that age group
the annual suicide rate is about 12 people per 100,000. This means that we can
expect 360 D&amp;D playing teenagers (12/100,000 x 3 million players) to commit
suicide.</div>

<li>
<p>They accept only those risks that they are able to properly evaluate (staying within their circle

scenarios, carry the expectancy of profit. These insurers ignore market-share considerations and are
sanguine about losing business to competitors that are firing foolish prices or policy conditions.</p>

<li>
<p>They limit the business they accept in a manner that guarantees they will suffer no
aggregation of losses from a single event or from related events that will threaten their independency.
They ceaselessly search for possible correlation among seemingly-unrelated risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They avoid business involving moral risk: No matter what the rate, trying to write good
contracts with bad people doesn&rsquo;t work. While most policyholders and clients are honorable and
ethical, doing business with the ftw exceptions is usually expensive, sometimes extraordinarily so</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>If you&rsquo;re a captain in the Navy and you&rsquo;ve been up for 24 hours straight and have to go to
sleep and you turn the ship over to a competent first mate in tough conditions and he takes
the ship aground - clearly through no fault of yours - they don&rsquo;t court martial you, but
your naval career is over.</p>
<p>Napoleon said he liked luckier generals - he wasn&rsquo;t into supporting losers. Well, the
Navy likes luckier captains.</p>
<p>You can say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too tough. That&rsquo;s not law school. That&rsquo;s not due process.&rdquo; Well, the
Navy model is better in its context than would be the law school model. The Navy model
really forces people to pay attention when conditions are tough - because they know that
there&rsquo;s no excuse. Very simply, if your ship goes aground, your career is over.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it was your fault or not. Nobody&rsquo;s interested in your fault. It&rsquo;s
just a rule that we happen to have - for the good of all, all effects considered.&rdquo;
I like some rules like that - I think that the civilization works better with some of these
no-fault rules. But that stuff tends to be anathema around law schools. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not due
process. You&rsquo;re not really searching for justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I am searching for justice when I argue for the Navy rule - for the justice of fewer
ships going aground. Considering the net benefit, I don&rsquo;t care if one captain has some
unfairness in his life. After all, it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s being court marshalled. He just has to look
for a new line of work. And he keeps vested pension rights and so on. So it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s
the end of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treat the employees badly. Reward bad work. Don&rsquo;t appeal to the employee&rsquo;s self
interests but to a goal no one understands. Don&rsquo;t inform people what the
company stands for, what rules apply, and the consequences for breaking them.
Make sure people don&rsquo;t know their areas of responsibility. Put the right person in
the wrong place. Don&rsquo;t let people know if they achieve a goal. Everything should
be impossible to measure. Never tell people why something should be done.
Surround the CEO with confused, unmotivated subordinates. Give key
customers reasons to be angry. Late and wrong deliveries, delays, and arrogance
will help. Let the customers associate the business with misery and make sure that
this feeling gets reinforced at every contact with the company.&rdquo;</p>

think a thing through backward is you take your initial assumption and say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try and

<p>That is not what most people do with their initial assumption. They try and confirm it.
It&rsquo;s an automatic tendency in psychology - often called &ldquo;first-conclusion bias&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s only
a tendency. You can train yourself away from the tendency to a substantial degree. You just
constantly take your own assumptions and try and disprove them.</p>
