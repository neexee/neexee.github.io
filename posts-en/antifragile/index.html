<p>Awesome book. It alleviated some of my scariest anxieties.</p>

<p>Future anxiety. Before I read it I thought I would miss something new if I&rsquo;m not going to read about new shiny things every day. Turns out, new developments are not that important. People cannot solve the same problems for centuries, so it&rsquo;s better to read classics to anticipate future.</p>

<p>Health anxiety. Health is complex. Doctors don&rsquo;t know much about it and almost always create problems on the long run. Well known example is antibiotics. Also when you think you&rsquo;re so tired you gonna die you&rsquo;re not even close to dying. It boosted my productivity.</p>

<p>Before the book I wasn&rsquo;t sure why I don&rsquo;t like government, education system and media. Turns out they&rsquo;re ruled by fragilistas. That&rsquo;s why those institutions produce so much bullshit.</p>

<p>The book made me realize that life gets much easier and better when you deliberately remove stuff from it. It doesn&rsquo;t get better if you patch it constantly. Sure, you&rsquo;re busy upgrading your lifestyle and you even might acquire comfort. But comfort kills people.</p>

<p>It takes time for the antifragility concept to sink in. The author is very repetitive from time to time. That&rsquo;s why I put 4 out of 5 stars. But it&rsquo;s an eye-opening book with unique voice. Definitely worth reading.</p>

Likewise, absence of fluctuations in the market causes hidden risks to accumulate with impunity. The longer one goes without a market trauma, the worse the damage when commotion occurs.</div>

So just as, for a plane that has a high risk of crashing, the notion of “speed” is irrelevant, since we know it may not get to its destination, economic growth with fragilities is not to be called growth, something that has not yet been understood by governments. Indeed, growth was very modest, less than 1 percent per head, throughout the golden years surrounding the Industrial Revolution, the period that propelled Europe into domination. But as low as it

He was trying to say that males and females have equal intelligence, but the male population has more variations and dispersion (hence volatility), with more highly unintelligent men, and more highly intelligent ones. For Summers, this explained why men were overrepresented in the scientific and intellectual community (and also why men were overrepresented in jails or failures). The number of successful scientists depends on the “tails,” the extremes, rather than the average.

<ul>
<li>Assume that the function under question is the squaring function (multiply a number by itself). This is a convex function. Take a conventional die (six sides) and consider a payoff equal to the number it lands on, that is, you get paid a number equivalent to what the die shows —1 if it lands on 1, 2 if it lands on 2, up to 6 if it lands on 6. The square of the expected (average) payoff is then (1+2+3+4+5+6 divided by 6) 2, equals 3.52 , here 12.25. So the function of the average equals 12.25.</li>
<li>But the average of the function is as follows. Take the square of every payoff, 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 divided by 6, that is, the average square payoff, and you can see that the average of the function equals 15.17. So, since squaring is a convex function, the average of the square payoff is higher than the square of the average payoff. The difference here between 15.17 and 12.25 is what I call the hidden benefit of antifragility—here, a 24 percent “edge.”</li>

  <div class="text-secondary">I discovered that I had been intuitively using the less-is-more idea as an aid in decision making (contrary to the method of putting a series of pros and cons side by side on a computer screen). For instance, if you have more than one reason to do something (choose a doctor or veterinarian, hire a gardener or an employee, marry a person, go on a trip), just don’t do it. It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason. Likewise the French army had a heuristic to reject excuses for absenteeism for more than one reason, like death of grandmother, cold virus, and being bitten by a boar. If someone attacks a book or idea using more than one argument, you know it is not real: nobody says “he is a criminal, he killed many people, and he also has bad table manners and bad breath and is a very poor driver.”</div>

Take for instance the following statement, entirely evidence-based: if you build muscle, you can eat more without getting more fat deposits in your belly and can gorge on lamb chops without having to buy a new belt. Now in the past the theory to rationalize it was “Your metabolism is higher because muscles burn calories.” Currently I tend to hear “You become more insulin-sensitive and store less fat.” Insulin, shminsulin; metabolism, shmetabolism: another theory will emerge in the future and some other substance will come about, but the exact same effect will continue to prevail.</div>

If you take risks and face your fate with dignity, there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don’t take risks, there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing. And when you take risks, insults by half-men (small men, those who don’t risk anything) are similar to barks by nonhuman animals: you can’t feel insulted by a dog.</div>
