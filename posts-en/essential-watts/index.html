<p>A collection of masterpieces. Watts discusses important concepts and he goes pretty deep.
Important concepts are time, Universe, God, work, ego and death. There&rsquo;s no dogmatic bullshit,
just a call to try to see things differently.</p>

<p>Sadly, I already knew most of the content from other sources.
I wish I could erase my memory and read it as a completely mind-blowing book.
Examples of main ideas? Past doesn&rsquo;t exist. You don&rsquo;t exist. Washing dishes is really fun. There&rsquo;s no causality of events.</p>



  
  

  

  
    
  
  
  
  

  
  

  

  
  
  
  

  
  

  

  
    
  
  
  
  

  
  

  

  
    
  
  
  
  





  


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>When some student asks, &ldquo;Where did you get all this?&rdquo; Well, you just picked up a thing
or two in Turkestan, or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite a bit older than I look,&rdquo;
or say that &ldquo;Reincarnation is entirely unlike what people
suppose it to be.&rdquo; Later, let on that you are in some way connected
with an extremely select in-group. Don&rsquo;t brashly claim
anything. Your students will soon do that for you, and, when
one hits on the fantasy that pleases you most, say, &ldquo;I see you
are just touching stage eighteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are two schools of thought about asking for money
for your services. One is to have fees just like a doctor, because
people are embarrassed if they do not know just what is
expected of them. The other, used by the real high-powered
tricksters, is to do everything free with, however, the
understanding that each student has been personally selected
for his or her innate capacity for the work (call it that), and
thus be careful not to admit anyone without first putting them
through some sort of hazing. Monetary contributions will
soon be offered. Otherwise, charge rather heavily, making it
dear that the work is worth infinitely more to oneself and
to others than, say, expensive surgery or a new home. Imply
that you give most of it away to mysterious beneficiaries.</p>

<p>As soon as you can afford to wangle it, get hold of a
country house as an ashram or spiritual retreat, and put students
to work on all the menial tasks. Insist on some special diet,
but do not follow it yourself. Indeed, you should cultivate
small vices, such as smoking, mild boozing, or, if you are very
careful, sleeping with the ladies, to suggest that your stage
of evolution is so high that such things do not affect you, or
that only by such means can you remain in contact with
ordinary mundane consciousness.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary">Now a trickster guru is certainly an illusionist, but one
might ask &ldquo;What eke is art?&rdquo; If the universe is nothing but
a vast Rorschach blot upon which we project our collective
measures and interpretations, and if past and future has no
real existence, an illusionist is simply a creative artist who
changes the collective interpretation of life, and even improves
on it. Reality is mostly what a people or a culture conceives
it to be. Money, worthless in itself, depends entirely on
collective faith for its value. The past is held against you only
because others believe in it, and the future seems important
only because we have conned ourselves into the notion that
surviving for a long time, with painstaking care, is preferable
to surviving for a short time with no responsibility and lots
of thrills.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>&ldquo;Now. gentlemen, I realize that you are dealing with one
of the toughest and most realistic aspects of life, since it is
your duty to defend your country to the bitterest end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not. therefore, detain you with sentimental
considerations or concerns of gentle sensitivity. We will get down to
the nitty-gritty. My basis for moral behavior, or any kind of
behavior, is a total selfishness. I am out for me, just as you
are out for the collective ego of your country. Of course, as
a strategian. I&rsquo;m not unsubtle about it. I&rsquo;m not going to push
people around and state bluntly what I want of them. On
the contrary, I use camouflage and come on like I&rsquo;m a very
sociable fellow who has other people&rsquo;s best interests at heart,
and by such deceptive ingratiation wangle others into doing
what I want.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, in this enterprise I have to consider two things.
What do I want, and what is this self which I am out for?
These are difficult questions to answer, but they really must
be answered. For a person who doesn&rsquo;t really know what he
wants is a source of confusion both to himself and others.
This kind of person fulfills desires which, when attained, are
not to his liking, or makes promises for which he subsequently
loses enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is therefore immensely important to clarify our personal
desires, and I might add. equally important to clarify our
political objectives, as a nation, and thus their implementation
through military strategy. (The implication of this was. of
course: Do we really want the responsibility and the
headache of ruling Southeast Asia. China. India?)
&ldquo;And then when I consider the nature of this self.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>I love so much. I find it most difficult to get at. Let us
suppose that I love beautiful women, money, caviar, Havana
cigars, pate de foiegras. Rolls Royces. and aloes-wood incense.
&ldquo;I could go on compiling such a list forever, but every single
item would formally be considered something other than
myself. For when I look for myself I can&rsquo;t find it. How then
can I love it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The point then is. speaking personally, that I can compile
a whole catalog of loves, but I don&rsquo;t find the lover. I suppose
I could also make a catalog of hates, which might include
boiled onions. American bread, fundamentalist preachers,
winter in England, physical torture (of myself or others),
prisons and &ldquo;mental&rdquo; hospitals, racism. and bureaucracy. But
if I should hate myself, as some are supposed to do. what
on earth am I hating?</p>

<p>So. then. I find The Real Alan Watts amazingly elusive. I
can be told who I am by parents, parsons, psychologists. and
others. But their opinions differ, and they are just opinions.
They cannot feel me from the inside, and thus, for my part.
I am most hesitant in forming firm opinions of others.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>We talk about our egos. We use the word I. I&rsquo;ve always been
tremendously interested in what people mean by the word
I because it comes out in curious ways in speech. For instance,
we don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;I am a body!&rsquo; We say, &ldquo;I have a body!&rsquo; Somehow
we don&rsquo;t seem to identify ourselves with all of ourselves. I
say, &ldquo;my feet,&rdquo; &ldquo;my hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;my teeth,&rdquo; as if they were
something outside me. And as far as I can make out, most
people feel that they are something about half way between
the ears, and a little behind the eyes, inside the head, and
from this center the rest of them sort of dangles. And the
governing principle in there is what you call the ego. Thats me!</p>

<p>But I just can&rsquo;t get rid of the idea that its a hallucination.
Thats not what you are at all. And its a very dangerous
hallucination because it gives you the idea that you are a
center of consciousness, energy, and responsibility that stands
over, against, and in opposition to everything else. You are
the principle inside your own body as if your body were an
automobile and you the chauffeur. You feel caught in a trap
because your body&rsquo;s something of a mess. It gets sick, tired,
hurts, and eventually wears out and dies. You feel caught in
the thing because you feel different from it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you feel the world outside your body is an
awful trap, full of stupid people, who are sometimes nice to
you but mostly aren&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re all out for themselves, like you
are, and therefore there&rsquo;s one hell of a conflict going on. The
rest of it, aside from people, is absolutely dumb — animals,
plants, vegetables and rocks. Finally, behind the whole tiling
there are blazing centers of radioactivity called stars, and out
there there&rsquo;s no air, there&rsquo;s no place for a person to live.</p>

<p>We have come to feel ourselves as centers of very, very
tender, sensitive, vulnerable consciousness, confronted with
a world that doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about us. And therefore,
we have to pick a fight with this external world and beat it
into submission to our wills. We talk about the conquest of
nature; we conquer everything. We talk about the conquest
of mountains, the conquest of space, the conquest of cancer,
etc., etc. We&rsquo;re at war. And its because we feel ourselves to
be lonely ego principles, trapped in, somehow inextricably
bound up with, a world that doesn&rsquo;t go our way unless
somehow we can manage to force it to do so.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>&hellip; feel this sensation of ourselves as an ego is a
hallucination. A completely false conception of ourselves as an ego
inside a bag of skin. What we really are is, first of all, the
whole of our body. Although the body is bounded by a skin
(I can differentiate between my outside and my inside) my
body cannot exist except in a certain kind of natural
environment. Obviously it requires air, and that air must be near a
certain temperature; it requires nutrition, it requires that it
be on a certain kind of planet near a certain kind of warm
star spinning regularly around it in a harmonious and
rhythmical way so that life can go on. That arrangement is
just as essential to the existence of my body as to its own
internal organs — my heart, my brain, my lungs, and so forth.</p>

<p>So there really is no way of separating myself as a physical
body from the natural environment in which I live.
Now, that means that I as a body go with my natural
environment in the same way exactly as bees go with flowers.
Bees look very different from flowers. The flower grows out
of the ground, colors and perfumes the ait The bee is
independent and buzzes around and flies. But where there are bees,
there are flowers, and where there are no flowers, there are
no bees. They go together and, in that sense, they make up
a single system. Substitute for the word system the word
organism, a single life form, a single individual, bees and
flowers, however different they look. Naturally, my feet look
very different from my head. Of course, a string is joining
them and therefore we say, &ldquo;Well, its all one, obviously&rdquo; They
are very different but they&rsquo;re both me. The feet and the head,
though different, are like the bees and the flowers — they go
with each other.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>How do we get this false sensation of being an ego? Well,
it seems to me that it&rsquo;s made up of two things — and the first
thing we have to understand is that, in the course of
civilization, we confuse our ideas and words and symbols about the
world with the world itself. The General Semantics group,
founded by Dr. Alfred Korzybski, have a little song: &ldquo;Oh, the
word is not the thing, the word is not the thing, hi, ho, the
derry-o, the word is not the thing.&rdquo; Obviously you can&rsquo;t get
wet from the word water. The image, the idea, the symbol,
the word is not the reality. The ego, what we feel as 7,
consists of the image or idea of ourselves as if seen in a mirror,
or as if heard played back on a tape recorder or television.</p>

<p>When I was a little boy I remember I had a friend up the
street called Peter, and I admired him very much. Sometimes
I came home and imitated Peter&rsquo;s behavior. My mother would
say to me, &ldquo;Alan, that&rsquo;s not you, that&rsquo;s Peter.&rdquo; You see, she
was giving me an image of myself. When I did anything
terrible she would say, &ldquo;Alan, its just not like you to do that.&rdquo; She
was busy building in me an image, an idea of the kind of
act I was supposed to put on, the kind of person I was
supposed to be.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary">The image that you have of yourself is simply a caricature!
A caricature is an excellent example: When we make a
caricature of Adolf Hitler, we pull down the hair and put a comb
under his nose instead of a mustache. In the same way, our
image of ourselves is a caricature of ourselves because it does
not include almost all the important things about ourselves;
it does not include all the goings-on inside the physical
organism. Oh, we get belly-rumbles; occasionally we&rsquo;re aware
of our breathing; occasionally we&rsquo;re aware that it hurts
somewhere. But for the most part we&rsquo;re totally unconscious of
everything going on inside us. We&rsquo;re unconscious of our brains
and how they work. We&rsquo;re unconscious of our relationships
to the external world, many of our relationships to other
people are completely unconscious. We depend on telephone
operators, electricians supplying our electricity, on all kinds
of service that we never even think about. We don&rsquo;t think
about air pressure. We don&rsquo;t think about the chemical
composition of the air we breathe, we don&rsquo;t think about cosmic
rays, gamma rays, X rays, the output of the sun. All these
things are absolutely essential to our life but they are not
included in the ego image.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you ask, &ldquo;how do I get rid of it?&rdquo; And my answer
to that is, that s the wrong question. How does what get rid
of it? You can&rsquo;t get rid of your hallucination of being an ego
by an activity of the ego. Sony, but it can&rsquo;t be done. You can&rsquo;t
lift yourself up by your own bootstraps. You can&rsquo;t put out fire
with fire. And if you try to get rid of your ego with your ego,
you&rsquo;ll just get into a vicious circle. You&rsquo;ll be like somebody
who worries because they worry, and then worries because
they worry because they worry, and you&rsquo;ll go round and round
and get crazier than ever.</p>

<p>The first thing to understand when you say, &ldquo;What can I
do about getting rid of this false ego?&rdquo; is that the answer is
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; because you&rsquo;re asking the wrong question. You&rsquo;re
asking, &ldquo;How can I, thinking of myself as an ego, get rid of
thinking of myself as an ego?&rdquo; Well, obviously you can&rsquo;t. Now,
you say, &ldquo;Well then, if s hopeless.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t hopeless. You haven&rsquo;t
got the message, thats all.</p>

<p>If you find out that your ego feeling, your will and all that
jazz, cannot get rid of that hallucination, you&rsquo;ve found out
something very important. In finding out that you can&rsquo;t do
anything about it, you have found out that you don&rsquo;t exist.
That is to say, you as an ego, you don&rsquo;t exist — so obviously
you can&rsquo;t do anything about it. So you find you can&rsquo;t really
control your thoughts, your feelings, your emotions, all the
processes going on inside you and outside you that are
happenings. There&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>So then, what follows? Well, there&rsquo;s only one thing that
follows: You watch what&rsquo;s going on. You see, feel, this whole
thing happening and then suddenly you find, to your amazement
 that you can perfectly well get up, walk over to the table,
pick up a glass of milk and drink it. There&rsquo;s nothing standing
in your way of doing that. You can still act, you can still move,
you can still go on in a rational way, but you&rsquo;ve suddenly
discovered that you&rsquo;re not what you thought you were. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not this ego, pushing and shoving things inside a bag of skin.
You feel yourself now in a new way as the whole world,
which includes your body and everything that you experience,
going.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>In other words, it is quite
impossible to describe the movement of my arm except in
relation to the rest of my body and to the background against
which you perceive it. The relations in which you perceive
this movement are the absolutely necessary condition for your
perceiving at all. More and more, a &ldquo;field theory&rdquo; of man&rsquo;s
behavior becomes necessary for the sciences.</p>

<p>Yet this is at complete variance with the way in which we
are trained by our culture to experience our own existence.
We do not, generally speaking, experience ourselves as the
behavior of the field, but rather as a center of energy and
consciousness which sometimes manages to control its
environment, but at other times feels completely dominated by the
environment. Thus there is a somewhat hostile relationship
between the human organism and its social and natural
environment, which is expressed in such phrases as &ldquo;man&rsquo;s
conquest of nature,&rdquo; or &ldquo;man&rsquo;s conquest of space,&rdquo; and other such
antagonistic figures of speech.</p>

<p>It would obviously be to the advantage of mankind if the
way in which we feel our existence could correspond to the
way in which existence is scientifically described. For what
we feel has far more influence upon our actions than what
we think. Scientists of all kinds are warning us most urgently
that we are using our technology disastrously, eating up all
the natural resources of the earth, creating incredibly beautiful
but wholly non-nutritious vegetables by altering the
biochemical balances of the soil, spawning unbelievable amounts
of detergent froth which will eventually engulf cities, over-
populating ourselves because of the success of medicine, and
thus winning our war against nature in such a way as to defeat
ourselves completely. All this advice falls on deaf ears, because
it falls on the ears of organisms convinced that war against
nature is their proper way of life. They have to be
unconvinced, and can be, to some extent, by intellectual
propaganda, scientific description, and clear thought. But this moves
relatively few people to action. Most are moved only if their
feelings are profoundly affected. We need to feel this view
of our individual identity as including its environment, and
this must obviously concern scientists who are trying to find
ways of controlling human feelings.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>To take a specific example, we all know that in modern
medicine nominalism and structuralism hold the field. When
you go through a process of examination by specialists
working upon you from different points of view, they will treat
you as a non-person, from the very moment you enter. You
are immediately put in a wheelchair — a symbol of the fact
that you are now an object. You will be looked at piecemeal,
X rays will be taken of various organs, and special tests will
be made of their functioning. If anything is wrong, you will
use his equivalents of wrenches, screwdrivers and blowtorches
to make certain mechanical alterations in your organism, and
it is hoped you will get along fairly well with these repairs!</p>

<p>But the opposite, minority school of medicine will say: &ldquo;This
is all very well, and the services of the surgeon are sometimes
greatly welcomed, but man must be considered as a whole.
He has complicated metabolic and endocrine balances, and
if you interfere with him seriously at one point, you will
affect him unpredictably at many others, for man is an organic
whole.&rdquo; Such are accused of being woolly-minded, old-
fashioned doctors, mostly from Europe, with a kind of nature-
cure background, who will use diet, complicated fasts, and
massage. The poor layman doesn&rsquo;t know whether to deliver
himself over to these old-fashioned naturalistic doctors or to
Mr. Sawbones with his very up-to-date qualifications.</p>

<p>Fortunately, precise science is coming to the rescue of our
man-as-a-whole. More recent studies are showing just how
diseases formerly regarded as specific entities, or afflictions
of a particular organ or area, are actually brought about by
responses of the central nervous system, acting as an integrated
whole. We are beginning to see how man, as a
complex of organs, is not an addition of parts, like an automobile.</p>

<p>His various organs are not to be treated as if they were
assembled together, but by seeing the physical body as a
unified or integrated pattern of behavior — which is just what
we mean when we talk about an entity or thing. What
happens when we have the feeling that we understand
something, when we say, &ldquo;Oh, I see&rdquo;? If a child asks, &ldquo;Why
are the leaves green?&rdquo; and you answer, &ldquo;Because of the
chlorophyll,&rdquo; and the child says, &ldquo;Oh!,&rdquo; that is pseudo-
understanding. But when the child has a jigsaw puzzle and
sees how it all fits together, then the &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; has a different
meaning from the &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; following the chlorophyll
explanation. To understand anything is to be able to fit various parts
into a system which is an integrated whole, so that they &ldquo;make
sense.&rdquo;</p>

All these alternative causes lie outside the individual.
The biological substratum itself is determined by prior
events in a genetic process. Other important events are
found in the scientific environment and in the culture
of the individual in the broadest possible sense. These
are the things which make* the individual behave as

it is useless to praise or blame him. It does not matter
that the individual may take it upon himself to control
the variables of which his own behavior is a function
or, in a broader sense, to engage in the design of his own
culture. He does this only because he is the product of
a culture which generates* self-control or cultural design

<p>The problem confronting all sciences of human behavior
is that we have the evidence (we are staring at it) to give us
an entirely different conception of the individual than that
which we ordinarily feel and which influences our common
sense: a conception of the individual not, on the one hand,
as an ego locked in the skin, nor, on the other, as a mere
passive part of the machine, but as a reciprocal interaction
between everything inside the skin and everything outside
it. neither one being prior to the other, but equals, like the
front and back of a coin.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>So we start with the premise that you are God, and you
don&rsquo;t know how you grow your body, how you make your
nervous system work, how you manage to emerge in this
environment of nature. All this is unknown to you, the you that
is not you, the you that is not the ego. This is God — that
is to say, not the cosmic boss, but the fundamental ground
of being, the reality that always was, is, and will be, that lies
at the basis of reality. Thats you.</p>

<p>Now, lets go into a more mythological kind of imagery.
Suppose you&rsquo;re God. Suppose you have all time, eternity, and all
power at your disposal. What would you do? I believe you
would say to yourself after awhile, &ldquo;Man, get lost.&rdquo; Its like
asking another question which amounts to supposing you
were given the power to dream any dream you wanted to
dream every night. Naturally, you could dream any span of
time — you could dream seventy-five years of time in one
night, a hundred years of time in one night, a thousand years
of time in one night — and it could be anything you wanted
— because you make up your mind before you go to sleep,
&ldquo;In night I&rsquo;m going to dream of so-and-so.&rdquo; Naturally, you would
start out by fulfilling all your wishes. You would have all the
pleasures you could imagine, the most marvelous meals, the
most entrancing love affairs, the most romantic journeys; you
could listen to music such as no mortal has heard, and see
landscapes beyond your wildest dreams.</p>

<p>And for several nights, oh, maybe for a whole month of
nights, you would go on that way, having a wonderful time.
But then, after a while, you would begin to think, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve
seen quite a bit, lets spice it up, lets have a little adventure.&rdquo;
And you would dream of yourself being threatened by all sorts
of dangers. You would rescue princesses from dragons, you
would perhaps engage in notable battles, you would be a hero.
And then as time went on, you would dare yourself to do
more and more outrageous tilings, and at some point in the
game you would say, &ldquo;In night I am going to dream in such
a way that I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m dreaming,&rdquo; and by so doing
you would take the experience of the drama for complete reality.
What a shock when you woke up! You could really scare
yourself!</p>

<p>And then on successive nights you might dare yourself to
experience even more extraordinary things just for the
contrast when you woke up. You could, for example, dream
yourself in situations of extreme poverty, disease, agony &ldquo;Sou could,
as it were, live the essence of suffering to its most intense
point, and then, suddenly, wake up and find it was after all
nothing but a dream and everything&rsquo;s perfectly OK,
Well, how do you know that&rdquo;s not what you&rsquo;re doing
already. You, reading, sitting there with all your problems, with
all your whole complicated life situations, it may just be the
very dream you decided to get into. If you don&rsquo;t like it, what
fun it&rsquo;ll be when you wake up!</p>

<p>This is the essence of drama. In drama, all the people who
see it know if s only a play. The proscenium arch, the cinema
screen tells us, &ldquo;Well, this is an illusion, it is not for real.&rdquo; In
other words, they are going to act their parts so convincingly
that they&rsquo;re going to have us sitting on the edge of our seats
in anxiety, they&rsquo;re going to make us laugh, they&rsquo;re going to
make us cry, they&rsquo;re going to make us feel horror And all the
time, in the back of our minds we have what Germans call
hinteigedanhen which is a thought way, way, way in the back
of our minds, that we&rsquo;re hardly aware of but really know all
the time. In the theater, we have a hintergedanken that ifs
only a play. But the mastery of the actors is going to almost
convince us that ifs real.</p>

<p>And, so, imagine a situation in which you have the best
of all possible actors, namely God, and the best of all
possible audiences ready to be taken in and convinced that ifs
real, namely God, and that you are all many, many masks
which the basic consciousness, the basic mind of the universe,
is assuming.</p>

myself away! You might find out who I really am! And what

same self, which many-eyed, as the mask of Vishnu is many-
faced, is looking out everywhere, one energy playing myriads
of different parts. Why?</p>

<p>If s perfectly obvious, because if you were God, and you
knew everything and were in control of everything, you would
be bored to death. It would be like making love to a plastic
woman. Everything would be completely predictable,
completely known, completely clear, no mystery, no surprise
whatever.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>You will notice a curious rhythm to what I have been
explaining, and this rhythm corresponds to the Hindu idea of
the course of time and the way evolution works, an idea
drastically different from ours. First of all. Hindus think of
time as circular, as going round — look at your watch, it goes
round. But Westerners tend to think of time in a straight line,
a one-way street, and we got that idea from Hebrew religion,
and from St. Augustine.</p>

<p>There is a time of creation, then a course of history which
leads up to final, eschatological catastrophe, the end of the
world, and after that, the judgment, in which all things will
be put to right, all questions answered, and justice dealt out
to everyone according to his merits. And that&rsquo;ll be that!
Thereafter the universe will be, in a way, static-, there will
be the eternally saved and the eternally damned.</p>

<p>Now, many people may not believe that today, but that has
been a dominating belief throughout the course of Western
history, and it has had a tremendously powerful influence
on our culture. But the Hindus think half of the world is
going round and round for always, in a rhythm. They calculate
the rounds in periods that in Sanskrit are called kalpas, and
each kalpa lasts for 4,320.000 years. And so a kalpa is the
period or manvantaia during which the world as we know
it is manifested. And it is followed by a period, also a kalpa
long, 4,320,000 years, which is called pzalaya, and this means
when the world is not manifested anymore.</p>

<p>And these are the days and nights of Brahma, the godhead.
During the manvantara when the world is manifested,
Brahma is asleep, dreaming that he is all of us and everything
that&rsquo;s going on, and during the pzalaya, which is his day, he&rsquo;s
awake, and knows himself, or itself (because ifs beyond sex),
for who and what he/she/it is. And then, once again, presses
the button — surprise! As in the course of our dreaming, we
would very naturally dream the most pleasant and rapturous
dreams first and then get more adventurous, and experience
and explore the more venturesome dimensions of experience,
in the same way, the Hindus think of a kalpa of the
manifested universe manvantara as divided into four periods. These
four periods are of different lengths. The first is the longest,
and the last is the shortest. They are named in accordance
with the throws in the Hindu game of dice. There are four
throws and the throw of four is always the best throw, like
the six in our game, the throw of one, the worst throw.
Now. therefore, the first throw is called krita and the epoch,
the long, long period for which this throw lasts, is called a
yuga. So we will translate yuga as an &ldquo;epoch,&rdquo; and we will
translate kalpa as an &ldquo;eon.&rdquo; Now the word krita means &ldquo;done,&rdquo;
as when we say, &ldquo;well done,&rdquo; and that is a period of the world&rsquo;s
existence that we call the Golden Age when every thing is
perfect, done to perfection. When it comes to an end, we get
treta-yuga that means &ldquo;the throw of three,&rdquo; and in this period
of manifestation there&rsquo;s an element of the uncertain, an
element of insecurity, an element of adventure in things. Ifs like
a three-legged stool is not as secure as a four-legged one —
you&rsquo;re a little more liable to be thrown off balance.</p>

<p>That lasts for a very long time, too, but then we get next
what is called dvapara-yuga. In this period, the good and the
bad, the pleasurable and the painful, are equally balanced.
But, finally, there comes kali-yuga. Kali means &ldquo;the worst
throw,&rdquo; and this lasts for the shortest time. This is the period
of manifestation in which the unpleasurable, painful,
diabolical principle finally takes over — but it has the shortest
innings.</p>

<p>And at the end of the kali-yuga, the great destroyer of the
worlds, God manifested as the destructive principle Shiva,
does a dance called the tandava, and he appears, blue-bodied
with ten arms, with lightning and fire appearing from every
pore in his skin, and does a dance in which the universe is
finally destroyed. The moment of cosmic death is the
waking up of Brahma, the creator, for as Shiva turns round and
walks off the stage, seen from behind, he is Brahma, the
creator, the beginning of it all again. And Vishnu is the
preserver, that is to say, the going on of it all, the whole state
of the godhead being manifested as many, many faces. So,
you see, this is a philosophy of the role of evil in life which
is rational and merciful.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Curiously enough, there is something parallel to this in
Christianity. There&rsquo;s a passage in St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the
Philippians in which he says a very curious thing: &ldquo;Let this mind
be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the
form of God, did not think identity with God a thing to be
dung to, but humbled himself and made himself of no
reputation, and was found in fashion as a man and became
obedient to death, even the death of the cross.&rdquo; Here you have
exactly the same idea, the idea of God becoming human,
suffering all that human beings can suffer, even death. And St.
Paul is saying, &ldquo;Let this mind be in you,&rdquo; that is to say, let
the same kind of consciousness be in you that was in Jesus
Christ. Jesus Christ knew he was God.</p>

<p>Wake up and find out eventually who you really are. In
our culture, of course, they&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re crazy or you&rsquo;re
blasphemous, and they&rsquo;ll either put you in jail or in the nut
house (which is the same thing). But if you wake up in India
and tell your friends and relations. &ldquo;My goodness. I&rsquo;ve just
discovered that I&rsquo;m God.&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll laugh and say. &ldquo;Oh,
congratulations, at last you found out&rdquo;.</p>

like King Edward VII. He was a very, very elegant man with
a little goatee beard. He didn&rsquo;t have sideburns as I do, and
he had shorter hair — a very elegant fellow, dressed
beautifully. And I thought he was the very image of God, Here I
am the same age as he was when I first knew him, and I have
five grandchildren, and I am no longer impressed by
grandfathers! I&rsquo;m one of them too! And this is the same idea of

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>I happen to like archery — not for killing things, but as a
sport. What I like most of all is to set an arrow free like a
bird. It climbs high into the sky, then suddenly turns and
drops.</p>

<p>What is it that fascinates us about that? We are delighted
by it because ifs not useful. It doesn&rsquo;t really achieve anything
that we would call purposive work. It is simply what we call
play. But in our culture we make an extremely rigid division
between work and play, You are supposed to work in order
to earn enough money to give you sufficient leisure time for
something entirely different called having fun or play.
This is a most ridiculous division. Everything that we da
however tough it is, however strenuous, can be turned into
the same kind of play as shooting an arrow into the sky or
spinning a prayer wheel. Lets, for example, take the
situation that I ran into a little while ago: I was in the New York
subway at 59th Street near Columbus Circle, and I wanted
to get my shoes shined, (Actually, I don&rsquo;t wear shoes except
on the East Coast, There one dresses respectably. On the West
Coast I wear Indian moccasins because it&rsquo;s the only
comfortable shoe I can wear.) I found a place to get my shoes shined
and there was a man who was making shoe-shining a real
art. He used his doth to beat out a rhythm. He had just the
same fascination in shining shoes as one has in spinning a
prayer wheel or shooting an arrow. Imagine if you were a bus
driver. A bus driver is ordinarily considered a totally harassed
person. He&rsquo;s got to watch out for all the laws, all the
competing traffic, the people coming on board giving their fares,
and he has to make change. And if he has it in his head that
this is work, it will be hell. But lets suppose he has a
different thing in his head. Suppose he has the idea that
moving this enormous conveyance through complicated traffic is
a very, very subtle game; he has the very same feeling about
it that you might have if you were playing the guitar or
dancing. And so he goes through that traffic avoiding this and
avoiding that and taking fares, and he makes a music of the
whole thing. Well, he&rsquo;s not going to be tired out at the end
of the day. He&rsquo;s going to be full of energy when he gets through
with his job.</p>

<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re condemned to be a housewife, which is
the most lowly of all occupations, and you have to dean up.
There are only four fundamental philosophical questions. The
first is &ldquo;Who started it?&rdquo; The second is &ldquo;Are we going to make
it?&rdquo; The third is &ldquo;Where are we going to put it?&rdquo; And the fourth
is &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to dean up?&rdquo; And this, the deaning up, is the
lowliest of all occupations, the housewife who washes the
dishes and the garbage collector who takes away the stuff.</p>

<p>Supposing the housewife about to dean up approaches
washing dishes in an entirely different spirit. And don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;m some sort of male chauvinist who&rsquo;s trying to talk women
into the idea of staying in their place. I&rsquo;m perfectly willing
to wash dishes too, because the art of washing dishes is that
you only have to wash one at a time. If you&rsquo;re doing it day
after day you have in your mind&rsquo;s eye an enormous stack of
filthy dishes which you have washed in years past and an
enormous stack of filthy dishes which you will wash in future
years. But if you bring your mind to the state of reality which
is only now, this is where we are, you only have to wash one
dish. Its the only dish you&rsquo;ll ever have to wash. You ignore
all the rest, because in reality there is no past and there is
no future. There is just now. So you wash this one. And
instead of thinking &ldquo;Have I got it really dean as my mother
taught?&rdquo; you turn the deaning movement into a dance, you
swing that plate around, you let the rinsing water run over
it, and you put it in the rack — you get a rhythm going.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>But before we get further involved in this, I want to draw
your attention to a fallacy in the very commonsense idea of
causality - events are caused by previous events from which
they flow or necessarily result. To understand the fallacy of
that idea, we have to begin by asking, &ldquo;What do you mean
by an event?&rdquo; Lets take the event of a human being coming
into the world. Now when does that event begin? Does it
occur at the moment of parturition when the baby actually
comes out of its mother? Or does the baby begin at the
moment of conception? Or does a baby begin when it is a gleam
in its father&rsquo;s eye? Or does a baby begin when the spermatozoa
are generated in the father or the ova in the mother? Or could
you say a baby begins when its father is born or when its
mother is born? All these things can be thought of as
beginnings, but we decide for purposes of legal registration that
a life begins at the moment of parturition. And mat is a purely
arbitrary decision-, it has validity only because we all agree
about it.</p>

<p>Let me show you the same phenomenon in the
dimension of space instead of the dimension of time. Lets ask, &ldquo;How
big is the sun?&rdquo; Are we going to define the sun as limited by
the extent of its fire? That&rsquo;s one possible definition. But we
could equally well define the sphere of the sun by the extent
of its light. And each of these would be reasonable choices.
We have arbitrarily agreed to define the sun by the limit of
its visible fire. But you see in these analogies that how big
a thing is or how long an event is, is simply a matter of
definition.</p>

<p>Therefore, when by the simple definition for purposes of
discussion we have divided events into certain periods — the
First World War began in 1914 and it ended in 1918 (actually,
all those things which led up to the First World War started
long before 1914, and the repercussions of that war continued
long after 1918) - we sort of forget we do it. We have a
puzzle, &ldquo;How do events lead to each other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In reality there are no separate events. Life moves along
like water, ifs all connected as the source of the river is
connected to the mouth and the ocean. All the events or things
going on are like whirlpools in a stream. Today you see a
whirlpool and tomorrow you see a whirlpool in the same
place, but it isn&rsquo;t the same whirlpool because the water is
changing every second.</p>

<p>What is happening is not really what we should call a
whirlpool, but rather a whirlpooling. It is an activity, not a
thing. And indeed every so-called thing can be called an event
We can call a house, housing, a mat, matting, and we could
equally call a cat. a catting. So we could say, &ldquo;The catting sat
on the matting.&rsquo; And we could thereby have a world in which
there were no tilings but only events, lb give another
illustration: A flame is something we say, &ldquo;There is a flame on the
candle.&rdquo; But it would be more correct to say. &lsquo;There is a
flaming on the candle,&rdquo; because a flame is a stream of hot gas.
Lets take another amusing example. Fist is a noun and fist
looks like a tiling, but what happens to the fist when I open
my hand. I was fisting, now I&rsquo;m handing, handing it to you.
So every kind of so-called tiling can be spoken of as an event
and because events flow into each other, the fisting flows into
the handing, we cannot say exactly where one ends and the
other begins.</p>

<p>So, therefore, we do not need the idea of causality to
explain how a prior event influences the following event.
Consider it this way: Suppose I&rsquo;m looking through a narrow slit
in a fence, and a snake goes by. I&rsquo;ve never seen a snake before,
so it is mysterious. Through the fence I see first the snake&rsquo;s
head, then I see a long trailing body, and then finally the tail.
Then the snake turns around and goes back. Then I see first
the head, and then after an interval the tail. Now if I call the
head one event and the tail another, it will seem to me that
the event head is the cause of the event tail. And the tail is
the effect. But if I look at the whole snake I will see a head-
tail snake and it would be simply absurd to say that the head
of the snake is the cause of the tail, as if the snake came into
being as a head first and then a tail. The snake comes into
being out of its egg as a head-tail snake. And in exactly the
same way all events are really one event.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>So the course of time is really very much like the course
of a ship in the ocean. The ship leaves a wake behind it, and
the wake fades out and tells us where the ship has been in
just the same way as the past and our memory of the past
tell us what we have done. But as we go back into the past.
101and we go back and back to prehistory and we use all kinds
of instruments and scientific methods for detecting what
happened, we eventually reach a point where all record of the
past fades away in just the same way as the wake of a ship.</p>

<p>Now the important thing to remember in this illustration
is that the wake doesn&rsquo;t drive the ship anymore than the tail
wags the dog. The power, the source of die wake, is always
in the ship itself, which represents the present. You can&rsquo;t
insist that the wake drives the ship. You can plot the course
of the ship on graph paper and calculate a trend by seeing
over what number of squares the ship has been doing its
wiggling, and make predictions as to where it will go next. This
would give you a trend as to where the ship is going and you
might say, &ldquo;Because we can plot the trend from the pattern
which the ship has followed, we can tell where it is going
and, therefore, we are inclined to think that where it has been
will determine where it will go.&rdquo; But that is not actually the
case. Where it has been is determined not by where it will
go but where it is going. To put that more accurately, where
it has been does not determine where it is going; where it
is going determines where it has been.</p>

<p>If you insist that your present is the result of your past,
you are like a person driving your car looking always in the
rearview mirror. You are not, as it were, open to the future,
you are always looking back over your shoulder to find out
what you ought to do. And this is something absolutely
characteristic of us and this is why human beings find it
difficult to learn and difficult to adapt themselves to new
situations. Because we are always looking for precedents, for
authority from the past for what we are supposed to do now.
that gives us the impression the past is all-important and is
the determinative factor in our.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>Now of course we have a method of passing the buck in
all matters of responsibility by saying. &ldquo;Well, the past is
responsible for me.&rdquo; For instance, when dealing with a
difficult child, we are apt to say, &ldquo;Well, bang him about, beat
him up. and maybe he&rsquo;ll change.&rdquo; But then we say. &ldquo;No. that&rsquo;s
not fair to the child to beat him up. because it was his parents&rsquo;
fault; they didn&rsquo;t bring him up properly:&rdquo; And so then we say.
&ldquo;Well, punish the parents.&rdquo; But the parents say, &ldquo;Well, excuse
me, but our parents were neurotic, too, and they brought us
up badly so we couldn&rsquo;t help what we did.&rdquo; And since the
grandparents are dead we can&rsquo;t get at them, and if we could
we would pass the whole blame back to Adam and Eve. We
would say. &ldquo;No. the serpent tempted me and I did eat.&rdquo; Then
it was the serpents fault!</p>

<p>When God asked Eve. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t thou eat the fruit of the tree
whereof I told thee thou shouldst not eat?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh.
but the serpent tempted me and I did eat.&rdquo; And God looked
at the serpent, and the serpent didn&rsquo;t make any excuse. He
probably winked — because the serpent, being an angel, was
wise to know where the present begins.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>And so, in this way, when we write history we find that
writing history is really an art. The historian keeps putting
a fresh interpretation on past events and in that sense he is
changing it. He is changing their meaning just like we were
changing the meaning of a former word by a later word by
saying, &lsquo;They went and told the sexton and the sexton tolled
the bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this way you can experience a curious liberation from
what the Hindus and the Buddhists call karma. The word
karma in Sanskrit actually means doing, action. Karma comes
from the root kri which simply means to do. When something
happens to me, an accident or an illness, a Buddhist or a
Hindu will say. &ldquo;Well, it was your karma.&rdquo; In other words,
you had done something in the past and you reap the
unfortunate consequence in a later time. Now thats not the real
meaning of karma. Karma does not mean cause and effect.
It simply means doing. In other words, you are doing what
is happening to you. And that, of course, depends upon how
you define the word you. For example, consider breathing;
am I doing it or is it happening to me? I am growing my hair;
am I doing it or is it happening to me? Tibu can look at it either
way. I am being sick, or I am being destroyed in an accident
— ill define myself as the whole field of events, the organism-
environment field which is the real me, then all the tilings
that happen to me may be called my doing. And that is the
real sense of karma.</p>

<p>But when we speak about freedom from karma, freedom
from being the puppet of the past, that simply involves a
change in our thinking. It involves getting rid of the habit
of thought whereby we define ourselves as the result of what
has gone before. We instead get into the more plausible, more
reasonable habit of thought in which we don&rsquo;t define
ourselves in terms of what we&rsquo;ve done before but in terms
of what we&rsquo;re doing now. And that is liberation from the
ridiculous situation of being a dog wagged by its tail.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>We must begin by showing the difference between Western
and Eastern ideas of omniscience and omnipotence. A
Chinese Buddhist poem says:</p>

<p>You may wish to ask where the Bowers come from,<br>
But even the God of Spring doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>A Westerner would expect that, of all people, the God of
Spring would know exactly how flowers are made. But if he
doesn&rsquo;t know, how can he possibly make them? A Buddhist
would answer that the question itself is misleading since
flowers are grown, not made. Things which are made are
either assemblages of formerly separate parts (like houses)
or constructed by cutting and shaping from without inwards
(like pots of clay or images). But things which are grown
formulate their own structure and differentiate their own parts
from within outwards.</p>

<p>Thus it would be absurd, in a Buddhist&rsquo;s view, to ask, &ldquo;Who
made the world?&rdquo; because the world as a whole is not
considered as an artifact, a structure made by putting formerly
distinct pieces together — pieces which were originally shaped
by an external agency from some kind of material. No analogy
is felt to exist between natural growth and human
manufacture.</p>

<p>If, then, the God of Spring does not make the flowers, how
does he produce them? The answer is that he does so in the
same way that you and I grow our hair, beat our hearts,
structure our bones and nerves, and move our limbs. To us, this
seems a very odd statement because we do not ordinarily
think of ourselves as actively growing our hair in the same
way that we move our limbs. But the difference vanishes when
we ask ourselves just how we raise a hand, or just how we
make a mental decision to raise a hand. For we do not know
— or, more correctly, we do know but we cannot describe how
it is done in words.</p>

<p>To be more exact: the process is so innate and so simple
that it cannot be conveyed by anything so complicated and
cumbersome as human language, which has to describe
everything.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>We are looking at the basic models underlying the
practice of psychotherapy. There are exceptions to this and you
must always understand that I&rsquo;m going to make exaggerations
and outrageous generalizations for purposes of discussion
rather than laying down the law. Our practice is based on
the world view of nineteenth-century scientific naturalism,
which has as its fundamental assumption that the energy
which we express is basically stupid — blind energy, libido
— and if s called the unconscious. The assumption of this
philosophy of nature was that the psychobiology of human
nature was a stupid mechanism, a fluke that had arisen in
a mechanical universe, and that if we were to maintain this
fluke and its values, it would be necessary for us to enter into
a serious fight with nature. Scientific naturalism was in fact
against nature, believing nature to be foolish and blind, and
therefore in need of being dominated by our intelligence
which, paradoxically enough, was the product of this
foolishness. But the fluke had happened.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back into the history of this idea. Western man,
whether he was a Jew, a Moslem or a Christian, had always
considered the natural universe to be an artifact, something
made, and a child in this culture very naturally seems to ask
its parents, How was I made? To make something is to create
an artifact; you make a table out of wood or a sculpture out
of stone. This is the basic mythology underlying our common
sense. We are mostly unconscious of the basic images in
which we think. That is why I say that we have an
intellectual unconscious. We are mostly unconscious of the basic
belief systems within which we think and behave. So here is
this basic belief system — we are all made. It would be
unnatural for a Chinese child to ask, How was I made? He might
instead ask, How did I grow? The idea of our being
manufactured objects is basic to almost all Western thought. In the
course of history, when we got rid of the idea of God as the
maker, we were stuck with the idea of the universe as a
mechanism.</p>

love. When a mother hangs on to her child too long and
doesn&rsquo;t let it be independent because of her concern, or
alleged love, the child becomes warped. Well if s the same,
you can smother-love yourself. You can hang on. You can be
full of anxiety. I know and you know, for many people this
is a regular program. They&rsquo;re anxious because they don&rsquo;t have
enough money, and they think. If only I could double my
income, everything would be okay. And they succeed. They
do it. So they have plenty of money. Then the next thing they
worry about is their health. They go to a doctor and they get
a complete medical examination, and the doctor says, &ldquo;As far
as I can see. you&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo; Well, they mink there&rsquo;s something
probably wrong, because this person is a born worrier and
maybe should go to a psychiatrist. So he looks you over and
says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything wrong.&rdquo; Well, then you worry about
politics. Is the revolution coming? Are the tax people going
to take away all your money? Will you be robbed? I mean,
there are endless contingencies you can worry about.</p>

off divine event to which all creation moves, and maybe that&rsquo;ll
turn up between now and your death.. .or even perhaps after
death. Everybody&rsquo;s looking for that thing somewhere else than
now. But if you accept death, a funny thing happens — you
discover how good now is, and thats really where you&rsquo;re
supposed to be. Very often people may get into these states when
they&rsquo;re threatened by death, when they&rsquo;ve given themselves
up for dead, or sometimes, too, in convalescing from a long
illness. In those transformed states of consciousness in which
we see this, there&rsquo;s sudden enlightenment about now.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>When you see that the whole point of life is this moment,
most other people seem objects of pity. You&rsquo;re rather sorry
for them. Because they are rushing around, madly intent on
something. They look insane on the streets. Going
somewhere. Wow. its important to get there. And their noses seem
to be longer than usual, sort of prodding into the future, and
their eyes staring. They rush about in cars. Looking out of
the window I see all these cars streaming down Lake Shore
Drive into Chicago.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re intent on something. What? Well, we have to go
to work. Why? Well, to make money. Why? Well. I mean one
must live. You must? If you say to any spontaneous process
— and life is a spontaneous process — &ldquo;You must happen.&rdquo;
its like saying to someone, &ldquo;You must love me.&rdquo; But we all
do that to our children. The basic rule for bringing up a child
— which every child learns — is. &ldquo;You are required and
commanded to do that which will be acceptable only if you do
it voluntarily^&rsquo; This is known as the double-bind. So we say
to our spouses. &ldquo;You must love me,&rdquo; and if I don&rsquo;t feel like
loving my spouse anymore, I&rsquo;m made to feel guilty, and when
I feel guilty, I feel I have to make an effort to be loving — but
nobody wants to be loved on purpose. I don&rsquo;t want to be loved
out of somebody&rsquo;s sense of duty. I want them to love me
because they can&rsquo;t help loving me. Then I feel its okay.</p>

<p>Ever so many people are thoroughly confused by being
commanded to do that which is only any good if its natural
— and living is such a thing. If I say to myself. &ldquo;I must live.&rdquo;
then life is a drag. Or I say, &ldquo;I must live because I have children
and I&rsquo;m responsible.&rdquo; But then all I do is teach my children
to have the same feeling, and they will teach their children
to have the same feeling, and life will continue to be a drag
for everybody concerned. So life can only not be a drag when
you understand its gravy. That is to say. it happens
unnecessarily, not under orders, but for kicks. Then you are free
from the oppressive duty to go on living.</p>
