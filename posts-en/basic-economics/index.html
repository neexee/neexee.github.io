<p>Useful read. I no longer believe those who talk about things selling &ldquo;below their real value&rdquo; or about
how terrible it is for the United States to be &ldquo;a debtor nation&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m skeptic about government programs to make this or that &ldquo;affordable&rdquo;. Same skepticism goes for statements and statistics about &ldquo;the rich&rdquo; and &ldquo;the poor&rdquo;. Same with notion of &ldquo;greed&rdquo; of capitalists. It&rsquo;s not mysterious why so many places with rent control laws also have housing shortages.</p>

<p>Writing is mediocre, ideas are good. First chapters are especially terrible, I had a feeling that there was no editing. Most of the examples are repetitive, it was pretty annoying. I wish it was more straight (maybe even cynical). But it&rsquo;s written in a simple language, that&rsquo;s a plus.</p>

the same country, as well as rapid economic growth overall. In
1978, less than 10 percent of China’s agricultural output was sold
in open markets but, by 1990, 80 percent was. The net result was
more food and a greater variety of food available to city dwellers

During and immediately after the Second World War, for

States, even though the population and the housing supply had
both increased about 10 percent from their prewar levels and
there was no shortage when the war began.</p>

<p>In other words, even though the ratio between housing and
people had not changed, nevertheless many Americans looking
for an apartment during this period had to spend weeks or
months in an often vain search for a place to live, or else resorted
to bribes to get landlords to move them to the top of waiting lists.
Meanwhile, they doubled up with relatives, slept in garages or
used other makeshift living arrangements.</p>

<p>Although there was no less housing space per person than before, the shortage was very real at existing prices, which were kept
artificially lower than they would have been because of rent control
laws that had been passed during the war.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>How to get rid of all this surplus farm produce was a continuing question for which all sorts of answers were devised over the
years. In theory, the surpluses built up during bumper crop years
could be sold in the marketplace during years when there were
smaller crops, without driving the price down below the price support level. In practice, however, this provided little relief.
Often the surplus food was either sold to other countries at lower
prices than the American government had paid for it or it was
given away overseas to meet various food emergencies that arose
in various countries from time to time.</p>

<p>The cost of agricultural price support programs to the taxpayers reached a peak of more than $16 billion in 1987, before
changes in the laws and policies cut that in half by 1991. However, this does not count the additional billions paid by the public
in the form of artificially higher food prices. For example, during
the mid-1980s, when the price of sugar on the world market was
four cents a pound, the wholesale price within the United States
was 20 cents a pound.</p>

<p>Although the original rationale for such programs was to
save the family farm, in practice more of the money went to big
agricultural corporations, some of which received millions of dollars each, while the average farm received only a few hundred
dollars.</p>

does greed vary so much from one time to another or from one
place to another?</p>

<p>In the Los Angeles basin, for example, homes near the ocean
sell for much higher prices than similar homes located in the
smog-chocked interior. Does this mean that fresh air promotes
greed, while smog makes home sellers more reasonable? To say
that prices are due to greed is to imply that sellers can set prices by
an act of will. If so, no company would ever go bankrupt, since it
could simply raise its prices to cover whatever its costs happened
to be.</p>

people don’t want is a road that leads ultimately to the bankruptcy court.</p>

<p>Prices are important because they convey information in the
form of incentives. Producers cannot read consumers’ minds but,
when automobile manufacturers find it harder to sell station wagons at prices that cover their cost of production and easier to sell
sports utility vehicles at cost-covering prices, that is all that the
automobile manufacturers need to know in order to decide what

simple as an apple is not easy to define because apples differ in

In a free market, those apples most in demand for whatever reason-are likely to have higher prices and those
least in demand lower prices. Produce stores and supermarkets
spend time (and hence money) sorting out different kinds and
qualities of apples, throwing away those that fall below a certain
quality that their respective customers demand.</p>

<p>Under price control, however, the amount of apples demanded at an artificially low price exceeds the amount supplied,
so there is no need to spend so much time and money sorting out
apples, as they will all be sold anyway. Some apples that would
ordinarily be thrown away under free market conditions may,
under price control, be kept for sale to those people who arrive
after all the good apples have been sold. As with apartments under rent control, there is no need to maintain high quality when
everything will sell anyway during a shortage.</p>

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>One of the incidental benefits of competing and sharing
through prices is that different people are not as likely to think of
themselves as rivals, nor to develop the kinds of hostility that rivalry can breed.</p>

<p>For example, much the same labor and construction material needed to build a Protestant church could be used to
build a Catholic church. But, if a Protestant congregation is raising
money to build a church for themselves, they are likely to be preoccupied with how much money they can raise and how much is
needed for the kind of church they want. Construction prices may
cause them to scale back some of their more elaborate plans to fit
within what they can afford. But they are unlikely to blame
Catholics, even though the competition of Catholics for the same
construction materials makes their prices higher than otherwise.</p>

<p>If, instead, the government were in the business of building
churches and presenting them to different groups, Protestants and
Catholics would be explicit rivals for this largess and neither
would have any financial incentive to cut back on their building
plans to accommodate the other. Instead, each would have an incentive to make the case, as strongly as possible, for the full extent
of their desires and to resent any suggestion that they scale back
their plans. The inherent scarcity of materials and labor would still
limit what could be built, but that limit would now be imposed politically and seen by each as due to the rivalry of the other. The
Constitution of the United States of course prevents the government from building churches for different groups, no doubt to prevent just such political rivalries and the bitterness, and sometimes
bloodshed, to which such rivalries have led in other countries.</p>

pay increases for themselves. However, it is worth considering
the consequences of the situation in government, where executives are likely to be rewarded according to how many people
they supervise and how large a budget they administer. These different situations create opposite incentives-to get as much work
done with as few people and resources as possible in private industry and with as many people and resources as available in
government. This is one reason why it often costs much less for
private companies to perform the same tasks as a government
agency performs. The public pays the costs, whether as consumers or as taxpayers.</div>

another large and highly successful union in getting high pay and
other benefits for its members. But here too the number of jobs in
the industry declined by more than 200,000 in a decade, while the
steel companies invested $65 million in machinery that replaced
these workers, and while the towns where steel production was
concentrated were economically devastated.</p>

<p>The once common belief that unions were a blessing and a necessity for workers was now increasingly mixed with skepticism
about the unions’ role in the economic declines and reduced employment in many industries. Faced with the prospect of seeing
some employers going out of business or having to drastically reduce employment, some unions were forced into ”give-backs”
that is, relinquishing various wages and benefits they had
obtained for their members. Painful as this was, many unions
concluded that it was the only way to save members’ jobs.</p>

replaced as they wear out, the logical economic conclusion for the
long run is to raise the fares. Politically, however, a candidate who
opposes the fare increase as ”unjustified” may gain the votes of bus
riders at the next election. Moreover, since all the buses are not going to wear out immediately, the consequences of holding down
the fare will not appear all at once but will be spread out over time.
It may be some years before enough buses start breaking down
and wearing out, without adequate replacements, for the bus riders to notice that there now seem to be longer waits between buses
and they do not arrive on schedule as often as they used to.</p>

<p>By the time the municipal transit system gets so bad that
many people begin moving out of the city, taking the taxes they
pay with them, so much time may have elapsed since the political
fare controversy that few people see any connection. Meanwhile,
the politician who won a municipal election by assuming the role
of champion of the bus riders may now have moved on up to
statewide office or even national office on the basis of his popularity. As a declining tax base causes deteriorating city services
and neglected infrastructure, the erstwhile hero of the bus riders
may even be able to boast that things were never this bad when
he was a city official, and blame the current problems on the failings of his successors.</p>

called-with the net result that land on the commons was so
heavily grazed that it had little left but patchy ground and the
shepherds had hungry and scrawny sheep. But privately owned
land adjacent to the common was usually in far better condition.</p>

<p>Why? Because, even in an extreme case where one country
can produce anything more cheaply than another country, it may
do so to varying degrees. For example, it may be twice as efficient
at producing chairs but ten times as efficient at producing television sets. In this case, the total number of chairs and television
sets produced in the two countries combined would be greater if
one country produced all the chairs and the other produced all
the television sets. Then they could trade with one another and

  <div class="text-secondary"><p>In a prosperous country such as the United States, a fallacy
that sounds very plausible is that American goods cannot compete with goods produced by low-wage workers in poorer countries. But, plausible as this may sound, both history and
economics refute it. Historically, high-wage countries have been
exporting to low-wage countries for centuries. Britain was the
world’s greatest exporter in the nineteenth century and its wage
rates were much higher than the wage rates in many, if not most,
of the countries to which it sold.</p>

<p>Economically, the key flaw in the high-wage argument is that
it confuses wage rates with labor costs-and labor costs with total
costs.</p>

<p>When workers in a prosperous country receive twice the wage
rate as workers in a poorer country and produce three times the
output per man-hour, then it is the high-wage country which has
the lower labor costs. That is, it is cheaper to get a given amount
of work done in the more prosperous country simply because it
takes less labor, even though individual workers are paid more.</p>

<p>The higher-paid workers may be more efficiently organized and
managed, or have far more or better machinery to work with.
There are, after all, reasons why one country is more prosperous
than another and often that reason is that they are more efficient
at producing output.</p>

others would aspire to, then the history of most great American
fortunes-Ford, Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc.-suggests that the
way to amass vast amounts of wealth is to figure out some way to
provide goods and services at lower prices, not higher prices.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>One of the popular fallacies that has become part of the tradition of anti-trust law is ”predatory pricing.’’ According to this
theory, a big company that is out to eliminate its smaller competitors and take over their share of the market will lower its prices to
a level that dooms the competitor to unsustainable losses and
forces it out of business. Then, having acquired a monopolistic
position, it will raise its prices-not just to the previous level, but
to new and higher levels in keeping with its new monopolistic
position. Thus, it recoups its losses and enjoys above-normal
profits thereafter, at the expense of the consumers.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable things about this theory is that
those who advocate it seldom provide concrete examples of when
it actually happened. Perhaps even more remarkable, they have
not had to do so, even in courts of law, in anti-trust cases.</p>

depriving the economy of purchasing power and thus endangering other people’s jobs. But money that is saved does not vanish
into thin air. It is lent out by banks and other financial institutions, being spent by different people for different purposes, but
still remaining just as much a part of purchasing power as if it

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary"><p>In the crudest form of the purchasing power fallacy, the enormous increase in output resulting from the industrial revolution led
many in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to wonder how
the economy could possibly absorb such unprecedentedly large
and growing production. What would happen when all the needs
of human beings had been met, as seemed imminent to some at the
time, and the machines and workers kept producing more?</p>

<p>As history unfolded, this proved to be one of many non-problems with which imaginative members of the intelligentsia have
managed to torture themselves, and alarm others, over the centuries. (Declining IQs, exhaustion of natural resources, overpopulation, and global warming are others)
The sating of human desires, which some feared in the early nineteenth century, still
seems remote today, even though we have an abundance of such
things as refrigerators, computers, and television sets that were
not even dreamed of then.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <div class="text-secondary">What a group of French economists known as Physiocrats
showed in the late eighteenth century was that the production of
goods and services automatically generates the purchasing power
needed to buy those goods and services. When the economy creates another hundred million dollars worth of output, that is also
another hundred million dollars worth of wealth that can be used
to buy this or other output. Production is ultimately bought with
other production, using money as a convenience to facilitate the
transactions.</div>

are not under the same pressures to get &ldquo;the most bang for the

survival. This effects efficiency, not only in the narrow financial
sense, but also in the broader sense of achieving avowed purposes. Colleges and universities, for example, can become disseminators of particular ideological views that happen to be in vogue
(&ldquo;political correctness&rdquo;) and restrictors of alternative views, even
